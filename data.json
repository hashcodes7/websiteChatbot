            "title": "Applying Rules in the Policy Administration Utility",
            "information": "Applying Rules in the Policy Administration Utility Rules against PTC FlexPLM objects must be created against all lifecycle states. PTC FlexPLM does not support lifecycle state-specific access control lists. Rules created against specific lifecycle states cause inconsistent results and are not supported. If a subtype (or a root type) is going to be set to not instantiable (to make it not selectable in PTC FlexPLM ), then it must be added to the wt.admin.hierarchyListAdditions.wt.access.PolicyAccessControlled property to make it visible in the Policy Administration utility. \u2022 Add entries to the site.xconf file and run the command xconfmanager -p . \u2022 Entries must follow this format: <AddToProperty name=\"wt.admin.hierarchyListAdditions.wt.access.PolicyAccessControlled\" value=\"fully qualified class name\"/> For example: <AddToProperty name=\"wt.admin.hierarchyListAdditions.wt.access.PolicyAccessControlled\" value=\"com.lcs.wc.planning.FlexPlan\"/> The requirements for policy administration in PTC FlexPLM are stricter than those allowed by the Windchill Policy Administration utility. Common Access Control List Rules These rules are true for both PTC FlexPLM and Windchill PDMLink . \u2022 Explicitly granting or denying an access control list applies to the type and all its subtypes. Example 1: \u25e6 Type structure in the Type and Attribute Management utility: \u25e6 Access rule in the Policy Administration utility: In this example, read permission is being granted. If this is the only rule created for the Color type, users of the Retail group have view access to both the Color type and LCSColorSubtype1 (because LCSColorSubtype1 inherits the rule from the Color type). \u2022 If you apply a rule to a given principal, and that principal is a group, then the rule applies to all members of that group. If there is a subgroup (a group as a member of a group), then the rule also applies to all members of the subgroups, including all subgroups below them. In Example 1, all users who are members of the Retail group directly, or are members of subgroups of the Retail group (groups that are members of Retail ), have view access to the Color type and its subtypes. \u2022 If a grant rule is not explicitly granted for any particular create, read, update, or delete action for a given type or its parents, it is considered a denial of that access. In Example 1, only read permission is being granted. Create, modify, and delete are not explicitly granted or denied. If this is the only rule created for the Color type, users of the Retail group have view access to the Color type and LCSColorSubtype1 . They do not have create, modify, or delete access to any of the Color types. \u2022 If two explicitly created rules resolve to the same type, any deny rules take priority. An explicit deny rule always overrules an explicit grant rule. For example, for the Color type and LCSColorSubtype1 , the Retail group has read access to the Color type. GroupC , a member of the Retail group, is denied read access to LCSColorSubtype1 . If a user belongs to GroupC , the user is denied access. Example 2: \u25e6 Group and user membership: The Retail group contains groups GroupA and GroupC . GroupA has userA as a member. GroupC has groupA and userC as members. \u25e6 Type structure in the Type and Attribute Management utility: \u25e6 Access rule in the Policy Administration utility: In Example 2, GroupC has explicitly been granted view access to the Color type. There is also a rule denying view access to GroupA members. Even though members of GroupA are granted access to the Color type as members of GroupC (because GroupA is a member of GroupC ), they are denied access to the Color type. This is because any explicit deny rule overrules any grant rule. Any other users in GroupC that are not members of GroupA have read access. Access to Subtypes In Windchill PDMLink , you can grant access to a subtype if the following apply: \u2022 A parent type has been granted access, and no other rules deny that access (directly to the subtype or any of its parents). \u2022 No specific access has been granted or denied to any parent type for the subtype (for example, null permission) and access is explicitly granted to the subtype. In PTC FlexPLM , you have access to a subtype if the root type has been granted access, and there has been no explicit deny permissions from the root type to (including) the subtype that would remove permission for the given user \u2022 If you do not have access for each particular create, read, update, or delete action for any given type, then you do not have that access on any subtypes for that type. You must have access to all parent types to have access to the subtype. \u2022 Once a deny rule has been applied, it denies access to the specific type and all subtypes for the type the rule is specified on. \u2022 A grant on subtypes does not add access if a parent type has an explicit deny, even if the parent type\u2019s parent grants access. Example 3: \u2022 Type structure in the Type and Attribute Management utility: \u2022 Access rule in the Policy Administration utility: In Example 3, users of the Retail group are explicitly granted view access to the Color type. They are explicitly being denied view access to LCSColorSubtype1 . As a result, the users of Retail group have view access to the Color type, but not to LCSColorSubtype1 or LCSColorSubtype2 . Access at the Root Type Once access is granted at the root type, you can further refine the access using deny rules. Once access has been denied to a given type (as applied to a given user), all the subtypes also have access denied. Example of a type and group configuration: This diagram contains a partial type structure on the left. The diagram assumes that the type structure is repeated for the Accessories and Footwear types. \u2022 For the Root/Apparel/Mens type, only the users in Mens Apparel group have access. \u2022 For the Root/Apparel/Womens type, only users in the Womens Apparel group have access. The type tree has Accessories and Footwear types that are siblings to Apparel , which is not shown in the diagram on the left. These would have similar group rules to the correlating groups. For this example, we are only setting up the permissions for types visible in the diagram and we are only setting up read permission. To accomplish this in PTC FlexPLM , there are two options: \u2022 Grant permission to the root type to all users who need access to any type in the tree. Create the appropriate explicit deny permissions to restrict access to the subtypes where users or groups should not have access. \u25e6 Create a rule that grants read permission to the Retail group for the root type. This grant then applies to all subtypes. If the permissions stopped here, access is open for all types to all users of the Retail group. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies read permission to the Accessories group for the Root/Apparel type. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies read permission to the Footwear group for the Root/Apparel type. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies read permission to the Mens Apparel group for the Root/Apparel/Womens type. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies read permission to the Womens Apparel group for the Root/Apparel/Mens type. \u2022 Create grant rules at the root type to all users that would need access to any of the types or subtypes in the tree. Use \u201cinverse deny\u201d rules to reduce the number of users that have access to each appropriate subtype. \u25e6 Create a rule that grants read permission to the Retail group for the root type. This grant then applies to all subtypes. If the permissions stopped here, access is open for all types to all users of the Retail group. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies access to all users except the Apparel group for the Root/Apparel type. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies access to all users expect the Mens Apparel group for the Root/Apparel/Mens type. \u25e6 Create a rule that denies access to all users except the Womens Apparel group for the Root/Apparel/Womens type. \u2022 Both options start with a parent group that contains all the groups that would require access to any type in the structure. \u25e6 This example uses the Retail group, but that is not strictly required. \u25e6 Once access is granted to the root, in each subtype the list of who has access is refined through deny rules. There are never any additional grant rules. \u2022 Both options take advantage of group organization to minimize the number of rules that need to be created. You are not strictly required to do this. \u25e6 When creating a rule, you can only select one principal. When creating or using explicit deny rules, if you do not have a good user organization, it is cumbersome to manage the policies by adding individual rules. \u25e6 In the first option, the Footwear group allowed the creation of a rule that denied access to Footwear . If this group had not been present, two rules would have been created: one to deny access to the Mens Footwear group and another to deny access to the Womens Footwear group explicitly. If there is less organization, more rules need to be created. \u2022 The two options differ in users that cross groups. \u25e6 The first option explicitly denies access to those in a particular group. If a user is in the Mens Accessories and the Mens Apparel groups, and if access is denied to those in the Mens Accessories group, access is denied to that user, even though the user is in the Apparel group. \u25e6 The second option denies access to those that are not in a particular group. If users are in the group, they continue to have access. If a user is in both the Mens Accessories and Mens Apparel groups, and if access is denied to all groups except the Mens Apparel group, access is not denied to that user, even though the user is in the Mens Accessories group. Explicit Deny Example \u2022 Group and user membership: \u25e6 The Retail group has GroupA and GroupB as members. \u25e6 GroupA has userA as a member. \u25e6 GroupB has userB as a member. \u2022 Type structure in the Type and Attribute Management utility: \u2022 Access rule in the Policy Administration utility: In this example, users of the Retail group ( userA and userB ) are granted view access to the Color type ( LCSColor ). GroupA has been explicitly denied view access to LCSColorSubtype1 . UserB can view objects of the Color type, LCSColorSubtype1 , and LCSColorSubtype2 . UserA can view the objects of the Color type, but not any objects that are of LCSColorSubtype1 or LCSColorSubtype2 . Inverse Deny Example \u2022 Group and user membership: \u25e6 The Retail group has GroupA , GroupC , and GroupD as members. \u25e6 GroupA has userA as a member. \u25e6 GroupC has GroupA and userC as members. \u25e6 GroupD has userD as a member. \u2022 Type structure in the Type and Attribute Management utility: \u2022 Access rule in the Policy Administration utility: In this example, view permission has been granted to the Color type ( LCSColor ) for all users in the Retail group (including subgroups). Additionally, permission has been denied to LCSColorSubtype1 to all who are not members of GroupC . This results in userA , userC , and userD being able to view colors on the Color type. Because userD is not a member of GroupC , userD is denied access to LCSColorSubtype1 , while userA and userC continue to have view access. Creating the Access Control List Against the Retail Group To grant or deny access to all users within PTC FlexPLM , create the access control list against the Retail group (because all PTC FlexPLM users must be a member of this group). \u2022 For example, if you want to grant read permissions to the Color type for all users in PTC FlexPLM , you would create a rule granting read access to the Retail group. \u2022 If you do not want all users in PTC FlexPLM to have access, you would create a rule that is against a subgroup of Retail . This ensures that the users being granted access are PTC FlexPLM users, yet restricts the set of users to those that would be appropriate. For example, you have a group called Color Users as a member of the Retail group. The access control list granting read permission would be against the Color Users group. This allows only those users to see any Color information. \u2022 If you want to grant access to a root type, but also ensure that no other rules are providing more access than explicitly stated in your rule, you would create a rule that is granting the access you want to grant, and another that is denying access to everyone else. For example, you might have a rule that grants full control to all users on WTObject . This is an example of something you should definitely not do. This would enable all users in the system to have full access to everything, where it is not explicitly denied. If, in this scenario you want to create a rule that ensures only Color users have access to colors, you would create two rules. \u25e6 The first rule would be to ensure the grant always remains, even if the rule against WTObject is removed. So you would create a rule granting read access to the Color Users group. \u25e6 Additionally, to ensure no other users can access the Color type (through the WTObject grant to all rule), you would create a rule that denies read access to all users except the Color Users group. \u25e6 These rules combined ensure that no users outside the Color Users group have access to the Color type, no matter what other grants are given.

Rules created in a domain below the RFA domain are applied to instances, but not type access checks. Rules created in subdomains can cause potential conflicts in end user screens. The type access checks (library search, create type selection, and so on) are not aware of rules in the subdomains. This can lead to situations such as the search returning results a user does not have access to, but attempts to view the instances returned in that search would result in access exceptions.

This profile allows users to have visibility to certain Windchill features (such as the product structure browser). \u2022 This profile automatically directs users to the PTC FlexPLM home page. If users are not members of the Retail profile, they can specify their home page to either Windchill or PTC FlexPLM . This is controlled by a preference.

You copy multiple products from the line sheet of the target season. You can copy multiple products of a single product type; however, you cannot copy multiple products of multiple product types. You must select each product type separately. From the side navigation bar, click My Seasons , then click the name of the season where you want to copy the products to. After you have selected a season, click Development > Line Sheet to view the line sheet. Then, from the main Actions menu, select Mass Copy / Link Products . 1.

When you have selected all of the products you want to copy, click Select . The Mass Copy / Link Products page appears. 5. Select a product type from the Copied Product Type menu, which includes the top-level product types for the season that you are copying the products to, as well as any lower-level product types. For example, if the season allows the Product/Apparel type, then the Product/Apparel/Woman , Product/Apparel/Missy , and Product/Apparel/Petite types would also be available, because they are at a lower level. All copied products become the selected product type. The Original Product Type field is an inactive field that displays the type of the original products. This is displayed for reference only. 6. Optionally, select a relationship type from the Relationship Type list. As with individual products, the product type you select for copied products controls which relationship types are available from the Relationship Type list. Relationship types are defined by your administrator, and can define a specific set of product options for copy. For more information on relationship types and product options, see the \u2018Selecting and Clearing Product Options\u2019 section in the Product Options on the Copy / Link Product Page topic. 7. Optionally, update the product name in the Copied Product Name field. The system automatically enters a product name in the Copied Product Name field. The default name for copied products is the original product name preceded by \u201cCopy of.\u201d For example, if you were copying the product Pleated Pants , the system would automatically enter the product name as Copy of Pleated Pants in the Copied Product Name field. 8. Click Next . 9. Under Product Options , select the product options to copy. Unlike copying individual products, copying multiple products only allows you to select generic product options, such as colorways, specifications, samples, and so on. Selecting a product option copies all of that option for all products copied. For example, if you select colorways, the system copies all colorways for all copied products. You cannot select individual product options when copying multiple products. Click the expand icon to the left of the product option category to toggle between expanding and collapsing that product option category and showing or hiding its options that are available. You can also expand and collapse generic product options by clicking their names. You can also click Select All to select all product options, or Clear All to clear all product options. If you selected a relationship type in the previous page, you can select certain product options. The ability to add or remove these predefined selections when copying multiple products is the same as when copying individual products. If you select a relationship type, the system allows you to do one of three edit options, depending on how the relationship type has been configured using property settings: \u25e6 Neither select nor clear product options \u25e6 Only clear product options \u25e6 Both select and clear product options 10.

Because BOM synchronization is a manual process, this table does not display those BOMs with which you have previously synchronized the current product. To synchronize BOMs, navigate to the BOM for the parent product, click icon, and select Synch BOM . Specifying BOM Sections and Insertion Mode Selecting Synch BOM takes you to the Map Product Variations page, where you can select a BOM to synchronize the current BOM to from the Synchable BOMs menu. Only the BOMs of those linked products that are children of the current product are available for selection. If you decide you do not want to synchronize BOMs, click Return to return to the product Materials page. To automatically refresh the page and display additional options, select a BOM from the Synchable BOMs menu. The View button, the Section menu, and the Insert Mode menu appear.

Use the browser\u2019s Back button to return to the Map Product Variations page. Selecting BOM Sections The Section menu allows you to specify which rows of the parent BOM you want to insert or replace in the target BOM. The insertion of replacement of BOM rows is controlled by the selection from the Insert Mode menu. For more information, see the \u201cSynchronization Insertion Mode\u201d section below. \u2022 Select All to synchronize all parent BOM rows with the rows of the target BOM. \u2022 Select Select to display the individual parent BOM rows to be selected for synchronization. Select the corresponding checkboxes for the rows that you want to synchronize. You can select the All checkbox to select all BOM rows. Selecting the All checkbox is the same as selecting ALL from the Section menu. The ability to select an insertion mode for the BOM rows is disabled for the Select option. The system automatically inserts the BOM rows. The option to replace BOM rows in the target BOM is not available. \u2022 Select individual BOM section names, such as fabrics, trims, or labels, to synchronize the parent BOM section with that section of the target BOM Synchronization Insertion Mode There are two options available from the Insert Mode menu: \u2022 Insert \u2014inserts the selected rows or sections from the parent BOM into the selected BOM. \u2022 Replace \u2014replaces the selected rows or sections into the selected BOM. This mode is disabled if you choose Select from the Section menu. By default, any selected rows are inserted, not replaced, when Select is chosen. Mapping Product Variations When you select a target BOM for synchronization, the system displays the product variations of both the parent and the target BOMs. Using menus, you can map different product variations between products. Using property settings, your administrator might have defined attributes for use to automatically map product variations to one another. Product variations might already be mapped when displayed; however, you can manually change the mapping. The Map Product Variations page contains boxes for each of the four variations: sourcing configurations, colorways, sizes, and destinations. The target BOM\u2019s variations appear on the left, and the parent product\u2019s variations are available for selection from menus within the boxes. These variations\u2019 drop downs are with the select2 widget styling and multiselected widgets behavior. These widgets search and select all functionality, and behave the same as a select2 multi-select form widget. Values are not required for these widgets. \u2022 The Sources box allows you to map parent sourcing configurations to target sourcing configurations. This mapping is especially helpful if the same source has a slightly different name on the parent or target product. \u2022 The Colorways box allows you to map parent product colorways to target product colorways. This mapping is helpful when colorway names differ from one another, such as seasonal differences in names. \u2022 The size 1 variation and size 2 variation (if applicable) can be mapped using the Sizes and Sizes2 boxes, respectively. For both size boxes, the target product\u2019s sizes appear on the left. Select a parent product size from the corresponding menu to map to the target product size. \u2022 You map product and target destinations in the same manner that you map other product variations. Select a parent product destination from the menu on the right to map to the target product destination on the left. \u2022 There are instances where a parent and target product\u2019s variations do not align, and you therefore do not want to map the variations to one another. To prevent variation information from being synchronized, you must leave the parent product variation value empty. If the value is not already empty, you can clear the value by selecting the empty value from the parent product variation menu. After you have finished selecting the BOM sections for insert or replacement, as well as the product variations to synchronize, click Complete at the top of the page. The system refreshes and displays the \u201cBOM synchronization successful\u201d message. After the BOMs have been synchronized, you can select another target BOM for synchronization from the Synchable BOMs menu. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

If the Instantiable field is set to No , the automatic creation of specification fails, and PTC FlexPLM displays an error. To enable the automatic creation of a specification: 1. Specify the following properties in the lcs.plugins.properties file: com.lcs.wc.foundation.LCSPluginManager.eventPlugin.201=targetClass|com.lcs.wc.sourcing.LCSSourcingConfig^targetType|ALL^pluginClass|com.lcs.wc.sourcing.CreateSpecification^pluginMethod|createSourcingSpecification^event|POST_CREATE_PERSIST^priority|1003^bypassSecurity|true com.lcs.wc.foundation.LCSPluginManager.eventPlugin.202=targetClass|com.lcs.wc.sourcing.LCSSourceToSeasonLink^targetType|Sourcing Configuration^pluginClass|com.lcs.wc.sourcing.CreateSpecification^pluginMethod|addSpecificationToSeason^event|POST_CREATE_PERSIST^priority|1004^bypassSecurity|true 2. Specify the following properties in the custom.lcs.properties file. com.lcs.wc.sourcing.CreateSpecificationForSourcing=specName com.lcs.wc.sourcing.AutoCreateSpecificationForSourcing=true 3. Define the specification for your specification sub-type. The full type path for all specification sub types that are auto-created must be defined. For example, com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Specification=Specification com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Organization=Specification\\\\Organization com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Organization\\\\Apparel=Specification\\\\Organization\\\\Apparel com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Mens=Specification\\\\Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Mens com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Womens=Specification\\\\Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Womens com.lcs.wc.sourcing.SpecificationSubtype.Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Childrens=Specification\\\\Organization\\\\Apparel\\\\Childrens Was this helpful?

            "title": "BOM Synchronization Default Mapping",
            "information": "BOM Synchronization Default Mapping The system uses property settings to define which attributes are looked at when mapping BOM variations. You can define attributes for the colorway, source, and destination variations. You cannot define attributes for the size variation because it is not typed. The system attempts to create a default mapping based on defined attributes. If mapping is successful, then the mapped value is automatically selected for the parent product BOM variation; however, you can manually change this value if desired. Out-of-the-Box The system does not define default attributes out-of-the-box. Configuration You can define primary, secondary, and tertiary attributes for variation mapping when synchronizing the BOM. Based on the attribute that you specify to be used for variation mapping, the system attempts to create a one-to-one mapping based on the first attribute value. If the system cannot create a one-to-one mapping based on the first attribute value, and a secondary attribute is defined, then the system uses the secondary attribute to attempt to create a one-to-one mapping. Similarly, if no mapping can be created based on the secondary attribute, and a tertiary attribute is defined, then the system uses the tertiary attribute to attempt to create a one-to-one mapping. If no one-to-one mapping can be made using any of the attributes, then the system does not make a default mapping. There are three property settings for each variation: one for the primary attribute, one for the secondary attribute, and one for the tertiary attribute. You are not required to use all three property settings; you can choose to define only a primary attribute, or only primary and secondary attributes. The table below outlines the basic form of all three property settings (primary, secondary, tertiary) for the variations for which you can define attributes for variation mapping. Variation and Attribute Precedence Basic Property Settings Colorway Primary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SKUPrimaryAttributeKey= <value> Colorway Secondary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SKUSecondaryAttributeKey= <value> Colorway Tertiary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SKUTertiaryAttributeKey= <value> Destination Primary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.DestinationPrimaryAttributeKey= <value> Destination Secondary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.DestinationSecondaryAttributeKey= <value> Destination Tertiary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.DestinationTertiaryAttributeKey= <value> Source Primary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SourcePrimaryAttributeKey= <value> Source Secondary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SourceSecondaryAttributeKey= <value> Source Tertiary com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SourceTertiaryAttributeKey= <value> For any of the property settings above, replace <value> with the key of the attribute that you want to use for mapping. You must use the attributes that are the same type of the variation that you are mapping. The table below outlines the variations and their corresponding attribute types. Variation Attribute Type Colorway Product Destination Product Destination Source Sourcing Configuration For example, if you want to specify the color attribute as the default attribute for colorways, enter color as the value for the primary mapping property setting. You must use the attribute key and not the label. com.lcs.wc.product.DefaultDimensionMapHelper.SKUPrimaryAttributeKey= color This property setting tells the system to automatically try to create one-to-one mapping based on the values of the color attribute for both the parent and child product BOMs. If no mapping can be made, then the system looks to the secondary attribute, if defined. If secondary or tertiary attributes are not defined and/or a one-to-one mapping cannot be established, the system does not create a default mapping. Was this helpful?

The basic property setting to disable the copying and pasting of a product option to and from the clipboard is: com.lcs.wc.clipboard.use <ProductOptionKey> = false Use the property settings in the preceding table to disable the ability to copy and paste product options to and from the clipboard, replacing the true variable at the end of the property setting to false in each instance. Clipboard Relationship Types Any previously configured relationship type can be selected from the clipboard, as long as the property settings are configured correctly. The primary relationship type property setting that affects clipboard functionality is the one that controls which relationship types are available when copying to and from specific product types. You might have to enter additional property settings to account for additional product types. If you create a relationship type strictly for use on the clipboard, then you must use all of the property settings listed previously to create that relationship type. Relationship types that are defined as linked types are available from the clipboard, provided they have been configured properly; however, no link relationships are established when selecting them from the clipboard. Out-of-the-Box Relationship Types As with all relationship types, none are defined out-of-the-box. Configuration of Relationship Types Only those relationship types that are configured to be available for the product type that you are copying to are available for selection from the clipboard. Furthermore, the original product type specified in the property setting must be the same as the copied product type. The system ignores the product type of the product options on the clipboard. The example below further illustrates this concept: jsp.product.CopyProduct.CopyRequests.Product\\\\ Apparel \\\\ Petite .Product\\\\ Apparel \\\\ Petite = Missy-Petite , Brand-Brand If the above property setting were entered, then the Missy-Petite and Brand-Brand relationship types would be available for selection when pasting from the clipboard to a Petite product Notice that the original product type, Product\\\\Apparel\\\\Petite , and the copied product type, Product\\\\Apparel\\\\Petite , are the same Selecting a relationship type from the clipboard only controls the attribute transfer values; it does not control which product options are selected. The following example, while a perfectly valid property setting, would not enable users to select the specified relationship types from the clipboard: jsp.product.CopyProduct.CopyRequests.Product\\\\ Apparel \\\\ Missy .Product\\\\ Apparel \\\\ Petite = Missy-Petite , Brand-Brand In the preceding example, because the original and copied product types do not match, the Missy-Petite and Brand-Brand relationship types are not available for selection from the clipboard. If a property setting with the same original and copied product types is not entered for a particular product type, then no relationship types appear in the clipboard copy mode menu when copying to that product type. For example, if you are copying product options from the clipboard to a product with the product type Product/Footwear/Childrens , and had not defined the property setting with Product\\\\Footwear\\\\Childrens as both the original and copied product types, then no relationship types would be available from the clipboard.

            "information": "Creating a Relationship Type The relationship type property setting serves a dual purpose: \u2022 It names the relationship type. \u2022 It specifies which relationship types are available when copying or linking from product type A to product type B. For a relationship type to be available from the clipboard, both the original and copied product types must be the same. Out-of-the-Box No relationship types are available out-of-the-box. You must follow the steps below to create any number of custom relationship types. These custom relationship types are available to users who are copying or linking products within the system. The property setting automatically enables copying; however, you must use a second property setting to define the relationship type as a link relationship. See Specifying Link Relationships for more information. Configuration Use the following basic property setting to create a relationship type and specify which relationship types are available by product type: jsp.product.CopyProduct.CopyRequests. <OriginalProductType> . <CopiedProductType> = <RelationshipTypeName> You can specify multiple relationship types to be available, and therefore create multiple relationship types. Relationship type names must be separated by a comma. The basic property setting that defines multiple available relationship types by product type, and by relationship types is: jsp.product.CopyProduct.CopyRequests. <OriginalProductType> . <CopiedProductType> = <RelationshipTypeName> , <RelationshipTypeName> , <RelationshipTypeName> The <OriginalProductType> and <CopiedProductType> entries can include product subtypes. You must first indicate the product type, and then the product subtype, if applicable. Product subtypes are entered as follows: Product\\\\ Apparel The Product/Apparel/Missy type is entered as follows: Product\\\\ Apparel\\\\Missy In the following example, the MissyPetite and BrandBrand relationship types are created, and also available when the original product type is Product/Apparel/Missy and the copied product type is Product/Apparel/Petite . jsp.product.CopyProduct.CopyRequests. Product \\\\ Apparel \\\\ Missy .Product\\\\ Apparel \\\\ Petite = Missy-Petite , Brand-Brand Naming Relationship Types Relationship type names provide the user with some indication of the original product and the copied or linked product, such as MissyPetite to indicate products copied or linked from the Missy product type to the Petite product type, or BrandBrand to indicate a brand exchange. There are certain characters that are prohibited when naming relationship types. These characters are: \u2022 The caret (^) \u2022 The period (.) \u2022 The equals sign (=) \u2022 The forward slash (/) Use a backward slash (\\) in the property setting when naming relationship types. The backwards slash does not appear on the page. Use a backward slash (\\) if you want to separate your relationship type name using spaces instead of characters. You must precede any space in your relationship type name with a backward slash (\\). For example, a property setting that contains the relationship type with the name Missy\\to\\Petite appears in the menu as Missy to Petite . It is recommended that you use a dash (-) to divide your relationship type name. You can also use an underscore (_). Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "information": "Defining Attribute Value Linking For relationship types that have been defined as link relationship types, you can use attribute value linking to automatically propagate updated attribute values on a given product to any products that are linked to it. As with attribute transfer property settings, custom property settings for attribute value linking must be entered in the attributesTransfer.properties file, which is found in the codebase. You can only propagate attribute values for the LCSProduct and LCSSeasonProductLink type classes. See Defining Attribute Transfer Values for related property setting values for type classes and names. Attribute value linking defined for attributes on the LCSSeasonProductLink type class only links the product-season attributes if the season of the linked products is the same. For example, if product A is on season Spring 2008, and is linked to product B on season Spring 2009, only the product attribute values are linked; the season must be the same for both product A and B for product-season attribute values to be linked. Likewise, if product A and product B are each on five seasons, but only share season Winter 2010, then only the product-season attributes for Winter 2010 have linked values. Out-of-the-Box No relationship types exist out-of-the-box. No attribute value linking is defined. Configuration To configure attribute value linking, you must enter a property setting for each attribute. The basic form of the property setting to control value linking is: SYNC. <TypeClass> ^ <TypeName> ^ <RelationshipTypeName> ^ <AttributeTypeContext> ^ <AttributeKey> > Each property setting entry is separated by a caret (^). The <AttributeTypeContext> entry is required only for product and season objects, as this object can exist on both the Product and Colorway types. Attribute context types must be entered in all capital letters, either as PRODUCT or SKU . If the property setting does not reference the product-season object, then you must omit the <AttributeTypeContext> entry, but still enter all carets. The resulting property setting contains two side-by-side carets following the <RelationshipTypeName> entry. The indication of a specific relationship type, such as Missy-Petite must be present in this property setting. The following is an example property setting: SYNC. com.lcs.wc.product.LCSProduct ^ Product ^ Missy-Petite ^^ department > In the example above, the system automatically propagates the department attribute on the Product type class on the Product type when products are linked using the Missy-Petite relationship type. The value of the parent attribute is propagated to all linked children attributes that are linked using the Missy-Petite relationship type The following example is a property setting that includes a <AttributeTypeContext> entry: SYNC.com.lcs.wc.season.LCSSeasonProductLink ^ Product ^ Missy-Missy ^ PRODUCT ^ designer This property setting tells the system to propagate the designer attribute on the Product type on the LCSSeasonProductLink type class when the Missy-Missy relationship type is selected. The value of the parent designer attribute is propagated to all linked children attributes that are linked using the Missy-Missy relationship type. Was this helpful?

One property setting controls those attributes and values when no relationship type is selected. The second property setting defines the attribute values for specific relationship types. The basic form of the property setting to control attribute transfers is: <TypeClass> ^ <TypeName> ^COPY. <RelationshipTypeName> ^ <AttributeTypeContext> ^ <AttributeKey> = <value> Each property setting entry is separated by a caret (^). The <AttributeTypeContext> entry is required only for product-season and cost sheet objects, as these objects can exist on both the Product and Colorway types. Attribute type contexts must be entered in all capital letters, either as PRODUCT or SKU . Specific Objects and Object Types Before you can enter property settings, you must first know which objects are available for attribute transfer, as well as their object type. This table only displays the root object type name. However, you can enter any corresponding object subtype in the property setting for the <TypeName> entry, as long as it is entered in the standard format. Product\\Apparel is an example of an object subtype entry. The two object types are equivalent to the <TypeClass> entry and the <TypeName> entry in the property setting (if you use the root object type). You can access these entries yourself from the side navigation bar by clicking Administrative > Type and Attribute Management . You can specify attribute transfer values for the following objects and their corresponding root object types.

Property Setting for Not Specifying a Relationship Type This property setting is used to specify the values for those attributes that are transferred when no relationship type is selected. The basic form of the property setting to control attribute transfers without specifying a relationship type is: <TypeClass> ^ <TypeName> ^COPY^ <AttributeTypeContext> ^ <AttributeKey> = <value> Each property setting entry is separated by a caret (^). The <AttributeTypeContext> entry is required only for product-season and cost sheet objects, as these objects can exist on both the Product and Colorway types. If the property setting does not reference a product-season or cost sheet, then you must omit the <AttributeTypeContext> entry, but still enter all carets. The resulting property setting contains two side-by-side carets following the COPY entry. ^COPY^^ <AttributeKey> You can set the property setting to one of two values: \u2022 A specific value, which all transferred attributes of this type have. \u2022 No value (blank), which clears the attribute value and allows the user to manually enter a value for the transferred attribute. The indication of a specific relationship type, such as MissyPetite is absent from this property setting. Examples of Property Settings for Not Specifying a Relationship Type \u2022 In this example, for all Constructioncomments attributes on the ConstructionInfo type class on the Construction type, the system enters a value of Copied Construction when no relationship type is selected. This property setting does not include an <AttributeTypeContext> entry because it does not reference a product-season or cost sheet object. com.lcs.wc.construction.LCSConstructionInfo^Construction^COPY^^constructioncomments=Copied Construction \u2022 In this example, for all specName attributes on the FlexSpecification type class on the Specification type, the system clears the original value and leaves the value of the copied attribute blank. This allows users to manually enter values for transferred attributes such as names, comment fields, and so on. This property setting does not include an <AttributeTypeContext> entry because it does not reference a product-season or cost sheet object. com.lcs.wc.specification.FlexSpecification^Specification^COPY^^specName= \u2022 In this example, for all margin attributes on the LCSCostSheet type class on the Cost Sheet type, the system enters a value of 60% when no relationship type is selected.

            "information": "Defining the Edit Option Use a single property setting to control whether or not users who select a given relationship type can manually select and deselect those product options that the relationship type automatically selects for copying or linking. In addition, a single property setting controls the default edit option for all relationship types in the system for which an edit option has not been defined. If you do not enter the individual relationship type property setting for a given relationship type, the system automatically uses the default edit option as specified in the default edit option property setting. Either property setting must be set to one of three edit options, described in the following table. Setting (Edit Option Key) Editing Options disable Users cannot make any changes to the predefined relationship type selections. removeOnly Users can only deselect those predefined relationship type selections that they do not want to copy. addOrRemove Users can both deselect the predefined relationship type options that they do not want to copy and select additional options for copy. Out-of-the-Box By default, users can both add and remove product options to and from the automatically selected list of product options. The out-of-the-box value for this property setting is addOrRemove . jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSelectionEditMode= addOrRemove No relationship types exist out-of-the-box, and thus no edit options are defined for individual relationship types. Relationship types for which you do not enter a property setting take the edit option of the system-wide default edit option. Configuration Use a property setting to change the system-wide default edit option. This edit option is applied to all relationship types that do not have an edit option specifically defined using the property setting in the next section. The basic form for this property setting is: jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSelectionEditMode= <EditOptionKey> To change the system-wide default, enter a different value for the <EditOptionKey> , either disable or removeOnly , depending on which edit option you want the system to use as a default. The following property setting prevents users from adding or removing product options when selecting a relationship type for which the edit option has not been specified: jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSelectionEditMode= disable The following property setting allows users only to remove the automatically selected product options when selecting a relationship type for which the edit option has not been specified: jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSelectionEditMode= removeOnly Use a property setting to define the edit option for a given relationship type.

One property setting controls the default familial relationship for the system, and another property setting defines this relationship for individual relationship types. Both property settings can be set to one of two values: parent-child and sibling . Out-of-the-Box By default, the system automatically creates parent-child relationships. The default value for the out-of-the-box property setting to control the system-wide default is parent-child . jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultRelationshipType= parent-child No relationship types exist by default; therefore, no familial relationships are established for individual relationship types. Configuration You can change the system-wide default to create sibling relationships by setting the value of the property setting to sibling : jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultRelationshipType= sibling Use a single property setting to define the familial relationship for each individual relationship type. Only use this property setting if you want the familial relationship to be different from the system-wide default, whether it is the out-of-the-box or configured value.

MissyPetite = BOM , SKUs , construction , destinations , source(all) Because the MissyPetite relationship type has been created with the removeOnly edit option, users selecting this relationship type can only deselect the product options listed above. They cannot select additional product options for copy. Defining Specification Components for Linking Unlike copy relationship types, which allow you to copy various product options, the system only allows you to link specification components. No link relationship types are defined out-of-the-box. As with copy relationship types, you must follow the steps below to define those product options, in this case those specification components, that are linked for each relationship type. To specify the specification components that the relationship type selects, enter a property setting in the custom.lcs.advCopy.properties file. jsp.product.CopyProduct.LinkObjects. <RelationshipTypeName> = <ProductOption> You can include as many specification components as you want. If you are including multiple specification components in the property setting, separate them with a comma. jsp.product.CopyProduct.LinkObjects. <RelationshipTypeName> = <SpecificationComponent> , <SpecificationComponent> , <SpecificationComponent> Only specification components are available for linking. \u2022 Bills of Labor (BOLs) \u2022 Bills of Materials (BOMs) \u2022 Constructions \u2022 Image Pages \u2022 Measurements Use the same product option keys as those outlined in the \u201cDefining Product Options for Copy\u201d section above. Defining Specification Linking You can also define relationship types to link specifications. By default, the system automatically makes no link between specifications. The default property setting value is clear : jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSpecLinkOption= clear You can change the default specification linking option by entering a different value for the property setting. There are two additional values for this property setting: link and maintainExistingLinkStatus . The result produced for each value varies depending on whether or not the original product is already linked to another specification (in other words, is a child of another specification). Property Setting Value Original Product Linked to Another Specification Original Product Not Linked to Another Specification link Creates link Creates link maintainExistingLinkStatus Creates link No link Setting the property setting value to link results in the following entry: jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSpecLinkOption= link For this property setting, the following is true for specification C, which is being linked to specification A: \u2022 If specification A is already linked to specification B (specification A is a child to B), then the system automatically creates a link from C to A (specification C is a child to specification A). \u2022 If specification A is not linked to another specification (is not a child to another specification), then the system automatically creates a link from C to A (specification C is a child to specification A). Setting the property setting value to maintainExistingLinkStatus results in the following entry: jsp.product.CopyProduct.DefaultSpecLinkOption= maintainExistingLinkStatus For this property setting, the following is true for specification C, which is being linked to specification A: \u2022 If specification A is already linked to specification B (specification A is a child to B), then the system automatically creates a link from C to A (specification C is a child to specification A). \u2022 If specification A is not linked to another specification (is not a child to another specification), then the system does not create a link from C to A (specification C is not a child to specification A). Whichever value you select for the property select is applicable for the entire system; all specifications adhere to this property setting with regards to linking when copying and linking products. You can override this selection for individual relationship types. Use a property setting to define the specification linking for individual relationship types. This overrides the system-wide setting, defined using the previous property setting, for that relationship type only. The basic form for this property setting is: jsp.product.CopyProduct.SpecLinkOption. <RelationshipTypeName> = <value> The value is either clear , link , or maintainExistingLinkStatus .

It is important to emphasize the concept of the BOM totals when they are fed into costing. Material costs always affect the cost to produce a product. Regardless of who purchases the materials, cost is always affected. Items can be produced using full package methods (FOB, where the factory is responsible for purchasing materials) or assembly only methods (CMT, where the manufacturer is responsible for purchasing materials). Rows of the BOM include quantity and price information. Cost of individual rows need to be calculated, and rows need to be totaled by section (shell, trim, labeling, and so on), and then finally by product. BOM totals often feed directly into a manufacturer\u2019s cost sheet for the product, and BOM information is often exported to a mainframe for purchasing, requirements planning, and final costing.

        "BillofMaterialsCreators.html": {
            "title": "Creators of BOMs",
            "information": "Creators of BOMs The information in a BOM comes from several different sources. It evolves over time, and although information can be entered initially by one group, another group often changes it later. Information, particularly on materials and colors, is continuously updated and changed. As products are dropped, added, changed, and reprioritized, as well as produced in many development states, completing a BOM from start to finish occurs over an extended period of time. It is crucial to have an awareness of these changes, as well as the reason and initiator of those changes. Access to creating and editing BOMs may be limited to specific groups and based on various development stages of a product. The Design Team The Design team is the first to generate the information that populates a BOM, and is also responsible for entering the materials and trim that make up the \u201clook\u201d of the product. Design works on many products simultaneously. Several of these products may be produced in the same fabric, or are part of the same collection that is marketed together. Since these groups of products often have the same theme, much of the trim, packaging, and labeling are similar or identical among products. Components may be entered directly into a BOM, but oftentimes, they are listed individually, or on trim sheets with related products. Trim sheets and other forms are used to standardize color and trim selections across products (to add a consistent \u201clook\u201d to related products). They are also used as a reference when creating the first samples. Although Design makes initial choices about trim and sources, other departments responsible for producing and costing the product may influence these choices. Forms used to track fabrics and trims are commonly created using Excel, and are often circulated and shared through e-mail, common drives, or through distributed hard copies. The Sample or Patternmaking Teams The Sample or Patternmaking teams also influence BOM entries. The person creating the pattern or sample influences which linings or interlinings are suitable for the garment. He or she also influences material decisions, such as button size and count, zipper size, and shoulder pad size. Any components that are affected by pattern measurements or construction methods can also be affected during this stage. In a CMT costing scenario, this information may be entered in a Cutters Must, and it later populates portions of the BOM for a specific product. Specification Writers Specification writers pull together all the functional aspects of fabric, lining, and trim components for a product, and enter them into a preliminary version of a BOM. The specification writer\u2019s BOM for apparel is typically divided into sections for fabrics, trim, and packaging and labeling. For footwear, it may include upper, bottom, packing, and logos and decorations. During this stage, selections are made for all components of a product and all colorways that a product is produced in. Many items are developed, or dyed to match (DTM). Other items (such as zippers, interlinings, and hem tape) are not developed, and color selections are instead based on supplier codes. Concerns of Specification Writers in Compiling a BOM If a manufacturer is producing a product in five colors, and the product uses five colored trims, then they must make 25 color selections. Items and item colors need to be specified in terms common to both the manufacturer as well as the supplier. To organize this process, colorways are created. Very often, color selections cannot be made without physical swatches of shell fabrics, or color standards used to represent these colors. Colors that can be used are based on seasonal and group standards. Actual color samples or standards may trickle in individually, which means the BOM is continually being edited, and referred to for ordering materials. Often, materials are added to a BOM before final supplier decisions are made. These items usually do not exist in any material library, but serve as placeholders until actual material and supplier information is obtained. It is often necessary to track a great deal of information per component listed on the BOM. This information varies by company and by user roles. Information may be specific to the manufacturer, the supplier, the cost, or even the status or approval of materials, as well as the user group accessing or entering the information. Although all items needed to build a product should be listed on a BOM, there are also special circumstances surrounding this requirement. In most cases, the manufacturer makes all material and trim selections and, although it may supply some materials listed on the BOM, it might expect the factory to order the others. Shell fabrics might be ordered by the manufacturer, while the remaining components might be ordered by the factory. Quotas and the logistics of shipping items back and forth can affect whether an item is supplied, or included, in the CMT or FOB cost. The BOM may even need to indicate whether components are supplied to the manufacturer or not. Communication of placement of colors is often necessary in a BOM (such as \u201ccolor blocking\u201d in skiwear). Both tabular and visual information is needed. Fabric and Trim Purchasers/Material Requirements Planners These groups use the BOM to order materials and trim (this is often done by the factory or vendor). Purchase Orders are written based on the information in the BOM. Similar products may be grouped so components can be ordered for groups of styles. To obtain the best pricing for materials, bulk orders can be placed by aggregating the components of many styles or collections. Sourcing and Costing Sourcing and Costing also need to work with the BOM. Where a product is produced may depend on the materials type (delicate silk or heavy cotton), as well as where the fabric is coming from. Several products may be grouped together to be produced in the same factory. A common example would be products using the same fabric. Additionally, yields can be adjusted once the product is further along in development. Costing and Accounting Costing and Accounting issue Letters of Credit to factories that manufacture their products. The materials listed in a BOM are a critical aspect of this process. Quality and Production (Agents and Factories) The Quality and Production teams for Agents and Factories use the BOM to ensure that the proper materials and trim are used by the assemblers on the finished product. Customs Compliance Customs Compliance uses the BOM to select the correct codes for importing products. Examples might be garment type, fabric or yarn content, yarn coarseness, and trim materials such as bone, leather, and metallics. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "information": "The Globalized Value Chain The components needed to produce a product directly affect the cost, and ultimately, the price of that product. Because the manufacturing of products today is global, the sourcing and costing of products, as well as the materials required to make them, can take on many variations. For example, a product designed in the United States uses materials from Europe and China, but the product is produced primarily in Japan, and later finished and packaged in South America due to quota restrictions. The cost to produce such a product is affected by material costs, manufacturing costs, multiple shipping costs and handling fees, and duties and quotas. The Bill of Materials (BOM) lists the materials used in a product. The combined cost of these materials can tie directly into the Cost Sheet of a product. Two typical methods of costing the design and manufacture of products are CMT and FOB. While there may be variations of these processes, they can be described as follows: \u2022 Cut, Make, and Trim (CMT)\u2014The CMT method of costing is used to negotiate pricing when the fabric is supplied to the manufacturer. When a bid is submitted, the manufacturer is quoting the price for cutting the product, assembling the product, and applying trim (such as buttons and zippers) to the product. \u2022 Freight On Board (FOB)\u2014This costing method is used to negotiate pricing where the manufacturer is also responsible for purchasing the fabric and trim needed to produce a garment. The manufacturer is quoting the price for cutting and assembling the product, as well as supplying fabric and trim. In both cases, the materials listed in the BOM affect price. In CMT, the designer might track the exact supplies and their cost, whereas in FOB, the manufacturer takes more responsibility for these. Many times, a BOM is used to list the materials and to make recommendations or to list requirements of specific components. In this case, the designer might control the materials, but the manufacturer ultimately purchases these supplies. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

These variations can be as simple as differing colors for individual colorways, in which the materials are the same, but the coloring of the material for different colorways is different. Variations can also be much more complex, such as materials that vary based on the factory in which the product is produced, or the sizes that a product is produced in. A factory may source materials from different locations, located nearby to their facility, and a larger size might require an elastic or use different shoulder pads. Quantities for materials may also vary based on size. When you create the top (product) level BOM, it contains the list of components that make up the given product. Assigning material, quantity, color, or any other pertinent information at the top level means that this information applies for any way the product is built. Applying an override for a given variation (or combination of variations) means that there is a variation in the manner in which the product is built for that variation. PTC FlexPLM allows you to create BOM overrides within the BOM editor. Once the main BOM has been created, you can create all possible overrides in that main BOM without having to create a new BOM for each override. To do this, click Variations on the Edit BOM page. You can select any combination of variations and apply your overrides to that particular variation of the BOM. The top-level BOM only requires one component to apply overrides. Adding a material and a supplier to the component, as well as selecting a color means that the selected material, supplier, and color apply for the given component across all BOM variations.

A factory might be unable to supply a given material in a particular color, or a different material might look better in a particular color. Because colors are tied to material-suppliers, overriding the material or supplier might require a change in the color selection as well, because any color selected or inherited for the given colorway might not apply to the new material or supplier.

It may also be necessary to replace a material based on size. For example, a larger size might require a stronger material for a waist band, or a different length or type of zipper might need to be used. You must select a size category from the Size Category list to select a size variation. Destination Overrides A BOM might include labeling or packaging information. This information might vary by destination, which requires destination overrides. Size Category Overrides Although you cannot create size category overrides, it might be necessary to view multiple size ranges for a product. Was this helpful?

            "information": "Variations and Overrides It is possible to create a BOM that is applicable to all sources that produce the product, or to all markets for which the product is produced, such as the US or Asia. In this case, a BOM can exist on a product, and can be used for all production possibilities. More frequently, producing a product in different places, for different markets, in different sizes or size categories, or in different colorways causes there to be differences in the way the product is produced. All of these differences are represented by variations in the PTC FlexPLM BOM. Variation Destination Source Describes the organizations responsible for producing the garment. A source can include any or all of the following groups: agents, vendors, factories, and suppliers. Multiple sources can be worked with during the development stage. Generally, the product is mass-produced with one or two of the most qualified sources, as determined during the Sample stage. The source variation often has variations in terms of material used, and/or where the material is sourced from. Colorway Refers to the different colors that a product is produced in. A single colorway may be composed of materials using several different colors. Examples of colorways that feature many colors are skiwear and active wear. Often the colorway variation lists common materials with the different colors for each colorway, along with each material used in a colorway. Destination Used to represent where a product is marketed. Differences such as sizing as well as labeling and packaging in different languages are common for a destination variation. Size Category Defines which collection of garments the product belongs or refers to. A product can have multiple size categories, so it might be produced in more than one group of sizes, such as Misses, Petite, and Woman, or Regular and Tall. Size Typically used to represent different quantities for different sizes. Common examples are cut lengths or zipper lengths, or different amounts of fabric for each size. Every product automatically has variations. Manually entering differences in the material data for these variations is an override. Any changes to the primary material used in a product such as color, quantity, material used, and so on, are considered an override. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

The CAD Data tab is not visible to you if your system administrator has not enabled the property. To associate a CAD document to a product: 1. Open the CAD Data tab. 2. Use the search function to locate the CAD documents that describe the product based on name and number attributes. You can search for drawings in any product or library that you have access to. Your system administrator can constrain the type and subtypes of CAD documents and CAD attributes that are available for use as search criteria based on your PTC FlexPLM system. 3. After submitting your search criteria, you can select one or more CAD documents from the search results to associate with the product. 4. Associating the CAD documents to the product results in a new iteration of the product. The associated CAD documents follow this product if it is carried over or moved.

For example, this allows a designer to create one CAD model but specify that it can be used for all color variations of a given product. The CAD Documents section of the specification details page only appears if your system administrator has set the property to enable this tab. Associating a CAD Document to a Product Specification To associate one or more CAD documents to a product specification: 1. Open the specification details page from the product page. 2. Select the Add Existing CAD Documents action. 3. Select the CAD documents that apply for the specification from the list of all CAD documents associated with the product. a. If you select a single CAD document to associate to the specification, the Update Specification to CAD Document page appears, allowing you to enter information specific to the use of this CAD document for the given specification. b. If you select multiple CAD documents to associate to the specification, the system refreshes the specification detail page with a complete list of associated CAD documents. Updating Specification to CAD Document Values To update PTC FlexPLM attribute data for specification to CAD document links: 1. Open the specification details page and select Update from the Actions menu in the rows of the CAD Documents table. 2. The details page displays the specification name, source name, product name, CAD document name, CAD document number, and CAD document version in the header. Values for Colorway, Size 1, Size 2, and Destination variation attributes can be updated on the details page. If the specification has PTC FlexPLM type attributes configured, these also appear in attribute groups. 3. Save any changes or updates to the values. The system returns you to the specification details page, or the Update Specification to CAD Document page. Viewing CAD Documents Associated to a Specification To view CAD documents already associated to a specification: 1. Open the specification details page. 2. Find the CAD Documents table. By default, this table is shown in collapsed view, and can be expanded to see the complete list of associated CAD documents 3. CAD documents associated to the specification appear in the table. From the Actions menu in the table, you can remove the association or view or update the details on the Update Specification to CAD Document link. 4. The CAD document name acts as a hyperlink to view the Structure tab on the CAD Data tab for the product. The CAD Data is read-only, you cannot edit it. Was this helpful?

            "information": "Comparing Calendars and Using Dashboards Calendars provide information in the context of a product or material. Dashboards provide information in the context of a season. Without calendars, dashboards contain no information to display. You can create multiple calendars and compare them with each other. By using one master calendar to track a set of milestones, and then comparing the calendars of many sub-objects to the master calendar, you can produce a report. This report compares the estimated or actual completion dates of the sub-objects with the target dates of the master calendar. This type of report is sometimes called a dashboard because it gives a high-level overview of many processes in one format. For example, a seasonal calendar tracks high-level events and milestones related to season development, while product calendars track events and milestones related to individual product development. Because seasonal development depends on the development of its products, some events in the season calendar map to or depend on events in the products calendar. There might be a season calendar event called \u201cLine Closed\u201d which maps to a lifecycle state. When the business determines whether or not to complete this event in the seasonal calendar, they might want to verify that all products in the season have been \u201cApproved for Production,\u201d which is defined as an event in the product calendar. Because this mapping between events is known, a report can be created to compare the target date of the season\u2019s \u201cLine Closed\u201d event against the estimated or actual completion date of the product\u2019s \u201cApproved For Production\u201d event. If the date of a product is beyond the target date of the season, then a flag can indicate that the product is at risk of slowing down the season. By showing this data for all products on a season, a dashboard is created to assess the health of a season\u2019s development. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

The calendar tracks other information related to the event such as target dates, estimated dates, actual dates, and event sequences. \u2022 Lifecycle states provide the highest level of detail. \u2022 Calendars provide an aggregate view of the current process. \u2022 Workflows provide lower-level details of specific, important tasks that need to be completed. \u2022 Actions capture each task in a list that needs to be completed. A calendar can be used to define milestones and deadlines for developing new products and associate target dates to that development. As the process progresses, the calendar can be used to review actual and estimated completion dates versus the targets which have been established. By using a calendar, managers can forecast project schedules and react before deadlines are missed. You can access different types of calendars in PTC FlexPLM . \u2022 To view a calendar in the context of a season, under the Site tab, click My Seasons > Development > Dashboards .

If the date does not have a (projected) label, the task was completed on that actual date. If the end date for a task has a (projected) label but the start date does not, the task has been started but not completed. An event on a calendar starts after another event is completed, rather than on a fixed calendar date. Each event on a calendar can be connected to each of the following pieces of information: Field Description Task Name Name of the event. *Preceding Task The task which must complete before this task can begin.

            "information": "Using Calendars with Lifecycle and Workflow Processes A calendar can be used in coordination with the lifecycle and workflow processes for a business object. By using a calendar to keep track of milestones and deadlines of interest, a workflow process can programmatically update the calendar to indicate the completion of an event or the regression to a prior event. The calendar can then be used as a status report of workflow progression and an estimator for future dates. If a calendar is used in coordination with a workflow, there is a relationship between a set of the work items or robots for a workflow and the events for a calendar. For example, a workflow might advance the lifecycle state of a product to be \u201cApproved For Production,\u201d while there is a deadline event defined in the calendar for \u201cApproved for Production.\u201d Upon completion of the workflow robot, the workflow could set the actual end date of the calendar event to reflect the change. Not all workflow tasks need to map to calendar events. Depending on the granularity of the workflow process or calendar, there might be many more of one or the other. This decision depends on the needs of the customer. A calendar could be used instead of workflow to track a process; however, the disadvantages of this include lack of role assignment, notification, and all other features of workflow.

Change Events The system automatically tracks product measurement set changes based on the following events: \u2022 When you create a measurement set \u2022 When you check in a measurement set \u2022 When you delete a measurement set \u2022 When you add a measurement set to a specification \u2022 When you remove a measurement set from a specification \u2022 When you change the lifecycle state of a measurement set The system does not track the original lifecycle state of the measurement set. The standard change tracking information only notes the new lifecycle state. Change Event Details The system tracks when you add, remove, or delete POM rows from the measurement set; these events appear as change event details when viewing the tracked changes table for the related change event. The system also tracks both measurement set header attributes and POM row attributes. The system tracks change event details, including designated attributes, for the following measurement set change events: \u2022 Check in \u2022 Delete (individual POM rows only) In addition to those attributes your administrator has designated for tracking, the system tracks the following measurement set attributes and information: \u2022 Measurement set size values \u2022 Measurement set base size \u2022 Measurement set grade rules \u2022 POM attribute used to indicate if the POM has been deleted Changed measurement set header attributes appear in the Measurement Set Header Changes table when you expand the related change event on the Tracked Changes tab; the table lists the name of the attribute that has been changed, as well as the original and updated attribute values. This table is sorted alphanumerically based on the name of the changed attribute. Changed POM rows and row attributes appear in the Measurement Set Table Changes table, which lists the POM name and number, as well as the name of the changed attribute and its original and updated values. This table is sorted by the sorting number attribute, which is maintained by PTC FlexPLM . If a POM is deleted, the system displays only the POM name and number with strikethrough. Additional columns in the table are left blank for this row. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "information": "Change Tracking XML Configuration The changeTracking.xml configuration file allows you to configure which change events and change event details are tracked. This file is located at <Windchill> /codebase/changeTracking/changeTracking.xml . The table below outlines the various tags you can insert within the change definition element. Do not include spaces in values assigned to tags. Tag Description <classname> Specifies the target class name. Must be the same target class as defined in the lcs.plugins.properties file. <processor> Specifies the processor used for the change event logic when any of the change events for the target object occur. <types> Contains multiple <type> elements. <type> Contained within the <types> element. Contains the specific type names. <typename> Contained within the <type> element. Specifies which PTC FlexPLM object type the change definition applies to; you can configure the system to track different changes for different subtypes of the same target object. If you are only using one <type> element for the target class, set it to the root type. All subtypes inherit this configuration unless you override the root Type settings for a given subtype. If you set an attribute on a subtype, it is only available to that subtype and changes are not tracked at the root level for that type. <events> Might contain multiple elements. Events are defined per type; event names, tracking designation, and tracked attributes are for the given type specified in the <type> element. <eventName> Contained within the <events> element. Identifies which change events are tracked for the target object. Out-of-the-box, PTC FlexPLM supports five events: \u2022 CREATE \u2022 UPDATE \u2022 CHECKIN (for select iterated objects) \u2022 DELETE \u2022 CHANGESTATE <tracked> Contained within the <events> element. Indicates whether the given event specified by the <eventName> element is tracked or not. This element supports two values: \u2022 true (event is tracked) \u2022 false (event is not tracked) <content> Contained within the <events> element. Indicates whether or not the content of an image page is tracked or not. This element supports two values: \u2022 true (adding and removing content is tracked) \u2022 false (adding and removing content is not tracked) This element applies to image pages only. You are not required to enter this element if you are defining change tracking for objects other than image pages. <attributes> Contained within the <events> element. Specifies those attributes whose values are tracked along with the given event specified by the <eventName> . Multiple attributes must be comma separated; if you do not need to track attributes for a given event, enter a single space between the <attributes> and </attributes> tags. The CHANGESTATE and DELETE events do not support attribute tracking; omit the <attributes> element when defining these events. The example below tells the system to track the following for the Product type and the Product/Apparel subtype: \u2022 Update change events \u2022 The product name and product number attributes when updates are made \u2022 Changes to the lifecycle state <changeDefinition> <classname> com.lcs.wc.product.LCSProduct </classname> <processor> com.lcs.wc.product.ProductChangeAuditProcessor </processor> <types> <type> <typename> Product </typename> <events> <event> <eventName> CREATE </eventName> <tracked> false </tracked> <attributes> </attributes> </event> <event> <eventName> UPDATE </eventName> <tracked> true </tracked> <attributes> productName,productNumber </attributes> </event> <event> <eventName> DELETE </eventName> <tracked> false </tracked> </event> <event> <eventName> CHANGESTATE </eventName> <tracked> true </tracked> <event> </events> </type> <type> <typename>Product\\Apparel</typename> <events> <event> <eventName>CREATE</eventName> <tracked>false</tracked> <attributes /> </event> <event> <eventName>UPDATE</eventName> <tracked>true</tracked> <attributes>Apparel_Test</attributes> </event> <event> <eventName>DELETE</eventName> <tracked>false</tracked> </event> <event> <eventName>CHANGESTATE</eventName> <tracked>true</tracked> </event> </events> </type> </types> </changeDefinition> Was this helpful?

It is assumed that if you are overriding the plug-in class and method that you are doing so for a specific business need or that the custom plug-in handles the complete implementation of the given event, including the creation of the ChangeAuditEvent and ChangeAuditEventDetails . You can use this approach if your business needs require you to capture event changes that are not currently supported out-of-the-box or to capture event changes for objects for which change tracking is not currently supported. In these cases, you can append similar entries to the changeTracking.xml file in order to gain additional flexibility with the customization or, if you do not require greater customization flexibility, you can have the system process these entries in the custom plug-in. Creating a Process Class Override You can create a processor class override and specify this overriding processor using the <processor> element in the changeTracking.xml file. When using a custom processor class, you must ensure that the custom processor class either extends the DefaultChangeAuditProcessor class or implements the ChangeAuditProcessor interface. If the custom processor class does not extend the DefaultChangeAuditProcessor class, then you must use the ChangeAuditProcessor class to implement all events for the given object. Was this helpful?

An example property setting is included at the end of this topic. Set the plug-in class to com.lcs.wc.changeAudit.DefaultChangeAuditPlugins if your system does not require customization. The system uses the specified processor class defined in the changeTracking.xml file to process tracking logic for the target class. The table below outlines the supported change events, as well as the mapping between the change events and the corresponding plug-in methods. Change Event Plug-In Method POST_CREATE_PERSIST trackNewObject PRE_UDPATE_PERSIST trackUpdateObject POST_CHECK_IN trackCheckInObject DELETE trackDeleteObject CHANGE_STATE trackObjectStateChange Check In Events The POST_CHECK_IN event is not supported for all objects; it is only supported when tracking bills of materials, construction sets, image pages, and measurement sets, due to the manner in which these four objects are edited. If you are logging changes upon check in, do not log changes on update events. To simplify event logging, use the check in event only for these four objects, as once the object is checked in, all relevant changes are tracked. Delete Events While you can register delete events, the system only logs delete events for certain objects due to the fact that once an object is deleted, there might not be a place within the system to view events related to that object. Currently, the system logs delete events only for those objects below the product object. If your business needs require the system to log delete events for other objects, you must create a class override as well as a custom report in order to view them.

Including Tracked Changes report in Tech Pack PDF Use the following property setting to generate a Tracked Changes report in the Available Reports selection when generating a tech pack PDF. jsp.specification.ChooseSingleSpecPage2.includedTrackedChanges= true Specifying this property adds the Tracked Changes: Expanded and Tracked Changes: Condensed option to the list of available reports. Adding this report to the chosen list brings up a Attribute - Change Tracking Since widget. The default selected value of the widget matches the value previously selected in the PTC FlexPLM header. The Tracked Changes report shows the changed attribute for specifications and specification components, not the full detail available from the Tracked Changes history tab. Automatic Expansion of the Latest Tracked Changes Box in the Sidebar Use the following property setting to automatically expand or collapse the Latest Tracked Changes box that appears on the Product tab in the sidebar. jsp.main.SideMenu.expandTrackedChanges= true Out-of-the-box, this box is automatically expanded if change events have occurred within the specified time frame. The property is set to true by default. Set this property to false if you want the system to automatically collapse the Latest Tracked Changes box when the Product tab opens. Users must manually expand the box to see the latest tracked changes. Automatically Selecting the Show Changed Product Info Check Box for the Line Sheet Use the following property setting to specify whether the system automatically selects the Show Changed Product Info checkbox option. jsp.season.LinePlan.showChangedProdInfo= false Out-of-the-box, this property is set to false . By default, the system does not automatically select this checkbox. If you want the system to automatically select the Show Changed Product Info checkbox, set this property to true . Users must still manually click Run to display the info icon for changed products. Specifying the Maximum Height for the Latest Tracked Changes Boxes A property setting specifies the maximum height, in pixels, of the Latest Tracked Changes pop-up box that is displayed in the line sheet and the Latest Tracked Changes box that appears on the Product tab in the sidebar. If the space needed to list the latest tracked changes exceeds the number of pixels specified in the property setting, the system displays a vertical scroll bar, which allows users to scroll through the list of changes. The default value for both property settings is 200. By default, both boxes are 200 pixels high. You can set this property setting to any numerical value you want, keeping in mind that the value represents the number of pixels and that users might have different screen resolutions. To specify the maximum height for the Latest Tracked Changes pop-up box in the line sheet, use the following property setting: changeauditevents.popup.maxheight= 200 To specify the maximum height for the Latest Tracked Changes box on the Product tab in the sidebar, use the following property setting: changeauditevents.navbar.maxheight= 200 Specifying the Matching Attribute for Measurement Set Comparisons A property setting specifies which attribute the system uses to compare measurement sets when checking for changes. The system uses the specified attributes to compare points of measure (POMs) to determine whether or not a POM has been updated, including being added to or removed from the measurement set. The system uses the number and measurementName attributes to compare POMs; therefore, changing the number or name of a POM indicates to the system that a new POM has been created. If your business needs require you to use the same POM name or number within a measurement set, you might experience issues when the system attempts to match POM names or numbers to check for changes. Use the following property setting to specify a new comparison attribute for POMs: com.lcs.wc.measurements.MeasurementsComparisonLogic.detailCompareAtts= attributeKey You can specify multiple attributes as the value of this property setting, using a list separated by commas. Specifying the Matching Attribute for Construction Set Comparisons A property setting specifies which attribute the system uses to compare construction sets when checking for changes. The system uses the specified attributes to compare construction detail rows to determine whether or not a construction detail has been updated, including being added to or removed from the construction set. The system uses the number attribute to compare construction details; therefore, changing the number of a construction detail indicates to the system that a new construction detail has been created. If your business needs require you to use the same construction detail number within a construction set, you might experience issues when the system attempts to match construction detail numbers to check for changes. For the construction set comparison to function properly, designate the number attribute on the Construction Detail type as required and unique. Use the following property setting to specify a new comparison attribute for construction details: com.lcs.wc.construction.ConstructionComparisonLogic.detailCompareAtts= attributeKey To specify multiple attributes as the value of this property setting, use a list separated by commas. Specifying the Matching Attribute for Bill of Material Comparisons A property setting specifies which attribute the system uses to compare bills of materials (BOMs) when checking for changes. The system uses the specified attributes to compare BOM line item rows to determine whether or not a BOM line item has been updated, including being added to or removed from the BOM. The system uses the section and partName attributes to compare BOM line items; therefore, changing the name of a BOM line item indicates to the system that a new BOM line item has been created. If your business needs require you to use the same BOM line item name within the same section of a BOM, you might experience issues when the system attempts to match BOM line item names to check for changes.

            "information": "Change Tracking Attributes and Business Objects Several attributes are associated with the change tracking functionality. The Dropped Measurement Attribute The Measurements type includes a Dropped attribute, which works in conjunction with the change event details table. If a POM is deleted from a measurement set, the system sets this attribute value to 1. This value tells the system to display that given POM with strikethrough in the Measurement Set Table Changes table for the related change event. The Dropped Construction Attribute The Construction Detail type includes a Dropped attribute, which works in conjunction with the change event details table. If a construction detail row is deleted from a construction set, the system sets this attribute value to 1. This value tells the system to display that given construction detail row with strikethrough in the Construction Table Changes table for the related change event. The Dropped BOM Attribute The BOM Link type includes a Dropped attribute, which works in conjunction with the change event details table. If a BOM line item row is deleted from a measurement set, the system sets this attribute value to 1. This value tells the system to display that given line item row with strikethrough in the BOM/BOL Row Changes table for the related change event. The Change Tracking Since Attribute The changeTrackingSince attribute is used to control the list of reference dates that appear in the Show Changes Since list in the PTC FlexPLM header. To access this attribute, do the following: 1. Navigate to the Type and Attribute Management utility. On the Site tab, under Administrative , click Type and Attribute Management . 2. Under Manage Types , expand the Business Object , and then select Common Attribute Lists . 3. On the Attributes tab, click Change Tracking Since to manage the attribute and its values, using the attribute update functionality. The default values appear on the Default Values tab. The default values are 1 day ago, 2 days ago, 4 days ago, 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago, 1 month ago, and a specific date. To add, update, or delete values in the attribute value list, see Editing Constraint Data and Enumerated Value List Constraints . When using entries in the enumerated value list, in the days field, enter the number of days for the system to calculate. For example, if you want the system to show changes for two weeks ago, enter 14. If a default value is not set in the Type and Attribute Management utility, the system uses the flexPLM.header.showChangeSince.default entry in the lcs.properties file to determine the default value. If the lcs.properties file is not defined, or if it is defined to an invalid value that is not in the attribute value list for the attribute, the system defaults to the following values: \u25e6 If the attribute value list contains 1 day ago, the system uses 1 day ago. \u25e6 If the attribute value list does not contain 1 day ago, the system uses the first value in the list.

By default, a primary source is designated for all products, and cost sheets for this source can be created for related seasons. Cost sheets are specific to a sourceandseason combination, enabling you to vary costs by source or by season. The cost of a product produced by a source within a single season can now be managed using multiple active and what if cost sheets. A cost sheet can be created to represent one or many variations of a product. These variations are the same as those used within the bill of materials. You can create an individual cost sheet for each combination of variations, or create a cost sheet that represents multiple variations of the product. For example, you might create a cost sheet for all dark or all light colorways, or for all small or large sizes. There is no limit to how many cost sheets you can create, and if customizations for BOM roll-up are being used, you can control which variation costs are used in cost sheets that represent multiple variations. All cost sheets can be viewed on the Costing page for the product, as well as in the line sheet.

Examples of how information might be organized on cost sheets include: \u2022 Material costs \u2022 Variable rates, such as those that vary by product, vendor, or country. These are typically pulled from tables using customization. \u2022 Vendor costs, which may use the variable rates above, as they apply to vendor-specific costs. \u2022 Any numbers that are rolled up from actual cost values, target values, and volume. \u2022 Converted calculations, in the case where you want to keep values of a different currency in a separate group. For information on calculated values, see the \u201cCalculated Value Attributes\u201d section below. Cost Sheet Types and Attributes PTC FlexPLM provides for automatic colorway costing. Attributes specific to any of these type contexts can be managed in the cost sheet. Colorway costing is most common among footwear producers where different colorways, often called styles, commonly use different materials and costs of materials. Cost sheet types are handled by two synchronized types : \u2022 Colorway attributes are entered on the Cost Sheet Colorway type. \u2022 Product attributes are entered on the Cost Sheet Product type. This synchronized type pairing supports synchronized attributes . For example, the manufacturing costs could vary by color, and be managed on the Cost Sheet Colorway type. The duty or shipping costs, on the other hand, would most likely not vary by color, and would therefore be managed on the Cost Sheet Product type. Attributes can be added to one type and marked as synchronized, and any changes to the attribute on one type are automatically changed on the attribute on the other type. If an attribute is not marked as synchronized, changes to an attribute on one type are not automatically changed on the attribute on the other type. Property Settings Users can enable updated costing functionality through a property setting. Using this functionality, you can create a cost sheet to represent a specific colorway, and change an attribute value for each colorway. You can also create a cost sheet that represents multiple colorways, and edit an attribute value that applies to all colors included in that cost sheet. Calculated Value Attributes Using the Type and Attribute Management utility, you can calculate values using other cost sheet values. An example is adding the material costs, the labor costs, and the shipping and handling costs into one value. As with derived string attributes, you can derive calculations by connecting multiple attribute values. Numerical attribute values that can be used in calculations are currency, float, and integer. Using these derived numerical attributes, you can create any number of calculations, ranging from simple to complex. For example, you can calculate a price using the suggestedWholesalePrice and minimumRetailMarkup attributes. (suggestedWholesalePrice * minimumRetailMarkup * .01) + suggestedWholesalePrice This equation multiplies the value of the suggestedWholesalePrice attribute by the value of the minimumRetailMarkup attribute, and then by the literal value of .01. The equation then adds this value to the value of the suggestedWholesalePrice attribute. For more information on creating these attributes, including additional examples, see Formulas .

You might refer to these types as CMT and FOB, or perhaps wovens and knits. You can even break them down by product type if the variation in costing is different at that level. If you are a designer or a retailer, or both, your cost sheet might also vary, and you might want to have multiple types to represent how you cost products (often called \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d).

For more information, see \u201cAbout the xconfmanager Utility\u201d in the Windchill Help Center or the Windchill Specialized Administration Guide . Nonce Expiration By default, the CSRF nonce is set to expire 24 hours after it has been created. The nonce timeout is not tied to the session timeout, because PTC FlexPLM has processes that can overrun the session timeout. This timeout value, set in minutes, is configurable and can be changed by adding the following property: com.ptc.core.appsec.CSRFNonceTimeout . For example, com.ptc.core.appsec.CSRFNonceTimeout=1440 Notification Emails Email notification can be set up to alert administrators to potential CSRF attacks. By modifying the following properties, you can configure the number of potential attacks recorded before a notification is sent, how often the notifications are sent, and who receives the notification. Property Description com.ptc.core.appsec.securityAlertEmailAccount The recipient of the potential attack notification email. By default, the email is sent to the administrator identified by the wt.admin.defaultAdministratorName property.

            "information": "Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Support for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) prevention was added in PTC FlexPLM 11.0 M030 for the majority of data-altering actions. The solution implemented by PTC FlexPLM is to generate a unique token for each user when their session is established. This unique token is called a nonce and is cached in the user session. Each time a data altering URL is generated by the server for this session, the server includes the nonce in a hidden form field named CSRF_NONCE . When the user submits the form for the action, this hidden field is sent back to the server which can then compare the nonce in the request with the nonce in the session. If the nonce is missing or does not match, then the request is rejected with the following error: A potential security problem was detected. Refresh the page and try again. If the problem persists, contact your administrator. The events detected as potential CSRF attacks are also recorded in the audit logs. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks can be prevented by ensuring that any request to perform an action that either creates, updates, or deletes data in the application can only have come from a valid user clicking a valid link generated from within the application, and not from a URL crafted by a third party and submitted unwittingly by the user. The various CSRF prevention techniques include: \u2022 The use of a unique token \u2022 The use of a challenge-response scheme, such as CAPTCHAs \u2022 Checking the HTTP Referrer Header \u2022 Checking the HTTP Origin Header \u2022 Establishing and using best practices when accessing the application To protect an action from CSRF attacks, do the following: \u2022 When an action is generated, clients must use appendNonce in csrf.js . \u2022 All requests need to go through Main.jsp or the standard flow of forwards and includes so that proper verifications are performed. For example, if a jsp is performing a forward that is not MainTemplate.jsp , Chooser.jsp , or Main.jsp and it is forwarding to a page other than MAINTEMPLATE , then it needs to be updated to go through MAINTEMPLATE correctly.

Update to the latest maintenance release for your version of PTC FlexPLM to get the latest software fixes. 2. Apply the latest security update patch for your current PTC FlexPLM maintenance release to get the latest security fixes. For more information, see the Security Update Patch download page. 3. Ensure that the user is not using Internet Explorer 8 in compatibility mode to access PTC FlexPLM . This mode causes Internet Explorer to send out truncated requests that do not include the CSRF nonce. 4. Review the symptoms and security logs to determine if this is a legitimate CSRF attack on your system. Signs of an attack include the following: \u25e6 The error occurred when navigating or clicking a link in another web page or application not related to PTC FlexPLM . \u25e6 The error occurred when clicking a link in an email that cannot be validated as originating from PTC FlexPLM . \u25e6 The error is accompanied by an unexpected request to authenticate with PTC FlexPLM if the user was not already authenticated. \u25e6 The PTC FlexPLM user interface does not appear normal. \u25e6 The PTC FlexPLM URL or hostname does not appear correct. 5. Determine the source of the problem. \u25e6 If the problem is reported by a user, work with the user to determine when they were getting the error and what action they were trying to complete. If the error occurred when performing a legitimate action on a legitimate PTC FlexPLM page, it might be a false positive that needs to be fixed in PTC FlexPLM . \u25e6 If the warning is found in a security audit report, review the report for information about the user, session identifier, IP address, date, time, and request that generated the warning. Contact the user listed in the report and determine what they were doing when the error occurred. \u25e6 If the warning comes in an email to the administrator, run a security audit report to get information about the user that generated the warning. Contact the user listed in the report and determine what they were doing when the error occurred. For more information, see \u201cCreating a Security Audit Report\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . \u25e6 If the warning is found when browsing the log files, run a security audit report to get information about the user that generated the warning.

In Type and Attribute Management , click Reusable Table > Pages . 2. Edit the attributes Object Activity , Object Type , and Tab Page as follows. For example, enable one or more dashboards for object of type Product\\Organization\\Accessories\\Mens and display the dashboard option in the Actions menu on the Product\\Specification page for this type. a. Identify the corresponding activity and tab page combination for this page using Fiddler or any tool that shows the request details after accessing the page. For this example, activity is VIEW_SEASON_PRODUCT_LINK and its corresponding tab page is SPEC_SUMMARY. b. In the Constraints tab of Object Type attribute of Pages , \u25aa Display Name\u2014 Product\\Organization\\Accessories\\Mens \u25aa Internal Name\u2014 ProductOrganizationAccessoriesMens c. In the Constraints tab of Object Activity attribute of Pages , click the Edit Enumeration icon for Enumerated Value List to add the following new values: \u25aa Display Name\u2014VIEW_SEASON_PRODUCT_LINK \u25aa Internal Name\u2014VIEWSEASONPRODUCTLINK d. In the Constraints tab of Tab Page attribute of Pages , click click the Edit Enumeration icon for Enumerated Value List to add the following new values: \u25aa Display Name\u2014SPEC_SUMMARY \u25aa Internal Name\u2014SPECSUMMARY When specifying the internal name, make sure that you provide the full path without space or special characters in the string. 3. Click Save for the configurations to take effect. If your business requires the ability to launch a dashboard from a FlexPLM client page that does not currently support embedding dashboard launch links in its Action menu, you may need to perform additional customization (JSP Override) to enable the Action menu for a page to support dashboard launch links. Perform call hasActiveDashboards() of ThingworxDashboardHelper by providing objectType , activity and tabPage value. The API returns true or false based on the availability of active dashboards. If true is returned, then include another JSP which will create the dashboard link based on the dashboard name. This JSP prepares the DOM to render the dashboard links. if((ThingworxDashboardHelper.hasActiveDashboards(\"OBJECT_TYPE_NAME\", \"ACTIVITY_NAME\", \"TAB_PAGE_NAME\"){ %> <%= optionDivider %> <jsp:include page=\"<%=subURLFolder+ TWX_DASHBOARD_OPTION %>\" flush=\"true\"> <jsp:param name=\"type\" value=\"<%= productType.getFullName(true) %>\"/> <jsp:param name=\"returnActivity\" value= \"\"<%=activity %> \" /> <jsp:param name=\"returnAction\" value= \"<%=action %>\" /> <jsp:param name=\"returnOid\" value= \"<%=oid%>\" /> <jsp:param name=\"tabPage\" value=\"<%= tabPage %>\" /> <jsp:param name=\"ajaxMenu\" value=\"true\" /> </jsp:include> <% } %> Was this helpful?

            "information": "Discussions A discussion in PTC FlexPLM is similar to an online forum or message board. Discussions allow team members to record an ongoing exchange of ideas in a secure space while referencing specific objects within PTC FlexPLM . Discussions can also be particularly useful for teams that include members in various sites and locations, or teams that include external suppliers. Discussions allow those team members to engage in conversations outside of email and conference calls. When discussions are created, users can choose other team members to participate in the discussion. This allows recipients to be notified of new messages. \u2022 Discussions in PTC FlexPLM have a few minor differences when compared to discussions in Windchill . For more information about discussions in Windchill , see the \u201cDiscussions\u201d topic in the Windchill Help Center . \u2022 Discussions can be specific to certain data, such as products or a BOM for a given product. Discussions can also be general, without being associated to specific data. General discussions are limited to the discussion creator and selected participants. \u2022 Discussions consist of topics and comments: \u25e6 Topics\u2014A topic is essentially a heading for a specific forum thread, allowing you to organize comments based on subject matter. Any team member can create a new topic and any number of topics can be created for data-specific discussions or general discussions. Accessing a topic allows team members to view and create comments associated with that topic. For more information, see Creating Topics . \u25e6 Comments\u2014A comment is a message posted under the selected topic or in reply to a previous comment. Comments can include attachments to local files and URL links. For more information, see Creating Comments . \u2022 You can view and contribute to discussions from the Discussions and My Discussions tables. For more information, see Using Tables . \u2022 Several actions for topics and comments are available to users, depending on their individual access and permissions. For more information, see Using Actions . \u2022 The following objects can have associated discussions: \u25e6 BOM (for both product and material) \u25e6 Business Object \u25e6 Color \u25e6 Construction (product-construction sets, not construction library template data) \u25e6 Cost Sheet \u25e6 Country \u25e6 Document \u25e6 Document Collection \u25e6 Effectivity Context \u25e6 Image Pages \u25e6 Last \u25e6 Material \u25e6 Measurements (product-measurement sets, not measurement library template data) \u25e6 Media \u25e6 Order Confirmation \u25e6 Palette \u25e6 Placeholder Product \u25e6 RFQ \u25e6 Sample \u25e6 Season \u25e6 Season Inspiration \u25e6 Season Line Plan \u25e6 Season Line Sheet \u25e6 Season Silhouette \u25e6 Specification \u25e6 Supplier Was this helpful?

Content is uploaded to the Windchill server through HTTP requests. The files that are uploaded represent either the primary content of a document object or its secondary attachments.

In a multi-user environment, where large graphics files are loaded as content for documents or image pages, there is a need to improve performance. Enabling the asynchronous conversion feature allows control to quickly return to the end user. Moving the image generation tasks to run in the background makes this possible. Asynchronous conversion provides a scalable technique for converting graphics files and prevents performance degradation when loading multiple large graphics files simultaneously. Enabling the asynchronous conversion functionality prevents overloading the Windchill server by shifting the conversion tasks to a lower priority background process. Was this helpful?

            "information": "Configuring FlexPLM for Asynchronous Image Conversion When dealing with small files, it might be advantageous to use synchronous conversion as the default processing behavior. Everything from system load, number of users, network bandwidth, upload times, can influence the setting of the threshold. Asynchronous conversion is configured by setting the following property: com.lcs.wc.document.imageGeneration.maxFilesizeConvertThreshhold This property determines the file size threshold for enabling asynchronous conversion. Any graphics file that is larger than this threshold is converted asynchronously. Any graphics file that is smaller than this threshold is converted synchronously. The administrator can also determine the number of threads used for asynchronous conversion with the following property: com.lcs.wc.util.ProcessingQueueSize The default number of threads is one. When generating thumbnails and web-viewable images, it is possible to delay the processing of the queue entry to ensure the document and its primary content is checked in. To configure the system to wait to generate the thumbnail or viewable for a set period of time, enter the following property settings in the custom.lcs.properties file: \u2022 Enter the following property setting to set the total time for the system to wait for the document to be checked in. The value of this property setting is the delay, specified in seconds. com.lcs.wc.document.aSyncGeneration.ttlSleepDelay=# \u2022 Enter the following property setting to specify how frequently the system verifies if the document has been checked in during the ttlSleepDelay period when creating the viewable. The value of this property setting is the delay, specified in milliseconds. com.lcs.wc.document.aSyncGeneration.viewableSleeperInterval=# \u2022 Enter the following property setting to specify how frequently the system verifies if the document has been checked in during the ttlSleepDelay period when creating the thumbnail. The value of this property setting is the delay, specified in milliseconds. com.lcs.wc.document.aSyncGeneration.thumbnailSleeperInterval=# Graphical Interface Changes When the thumbnail file or the web-viewable file is created synchronously, the user can view the results immediately. This is not the case when the conversion is asynchronous. Control is returned to the browser as soon as the document and its contents are uploaded and checked in, or as soon as the image page and its contents are uploaded and checked in. The user is unable to view the thumbnail or web-viewable file that is the result of the asynchronous conversion until the queue entry completes processing for the conversion task and the user refreshes or reloads the view page in the browser. By default, a blank image appears when the asynchronous conversion is in process. Use the following properties to configure a work-in-process image to inform the user that the uploaded image is being processed in the background: com.lcs.wc.document.imageGeneration.async.workInProcessImage.enabled=true com.lcs.wc.document.imageGeneration.async.workInProcessImage.url.path= /Windchill/rfa/images/blue-loading.gif Was this helpful?

            "information": "Overview of Asynchronous Image Conversion When there is a need to asynchronously convert vector-based image files to web-viewable formats or thumbnail image files, FlexPLM uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) processing queue (an instance of wt.queue.ProcessingQueue ). Queues are initiated when the document service is started by the system. It is possible to configure more than one queue to be used to perform conversion tasks. For more information about queues, see the \"Understanding Background Queues\" section of the PTC Windchill Specialized Administration Guide . Details for all configuration options can be found in the next section. The Queue Manager can be viewed under Windchill Home Page > Site > Utilities . Note that all queues that run conversion tasks are named ImageMagickQueue <#> . Each conversion task is added to a queue creating a queue entry and the queue entries are executed by the queue service. When a conversion task is waiting to be run, a LogEntry instance is created for the document that the conversion task is associated to. At any time, you can query the LogEntry instance specific to a given document to determine the status of the pending conversion task queue entry. This LogEntry instance also appears on the view details page for the document or images page. Note the \u201cPending File Conversion and Upload\u201d status message near the bottom of the image page. If the execution of a conversion task queue entry succeeds, the system removes the conversion task entry from the queue, deletes the LogEntry instance, and removes the message previously displayed on the view details page. If the execution of a conversion task queue entry fails, the system updates the status of the LogEntry instance to indicate that the conversion failed. The LogEntry instance on the view details page shows a failure. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

PTC recommends using mTLS when working in a production environment. An SSL connection requires that both systems trust each other. The HTTP server on the Windchill server must be configured to trust the Publishing server. The following steps give an overview of the process for configuring SSL. FlexPLM Server Configuration Changes 1. Update PTC HTTP server configuration to reference the CA certificates file. a. Create a ca-bundle.crt in <HTTPSERVER_HOME>\\conf . This location is recommended but not required. b. Save ca-bundle.crt . c. Create a sslclientauth.conf file at <HTTPSERVER_HOME>\\conf\\sslvhostconf.d . d. Add SSLCACertificateFile to <HTTPSERVER_HOME>\\ca-bundle.crt so that it refers to the ca-bundle.crt file. For example: SSLCACertificateFile <HTTPSERVER_HOME>\\conf\\ca-bundle.crt e. Save the changes. 2. Add the Publishing server certificate to PTC HTTP server\u2019s list of trusted CA certificates. a. Open the ca-bundle.crt file you pointed in the sslClientAuth entry. b. Edit ca-bundle.crt and paste the PEM file content of Publishing server client certificate. c. Save the changes. 3. Configure PTC HTTP server for the sslClientAuth URL. a. Search for the Windchill web app name in <WT_HOME>/codebase/wt.properties in the wt.webapp.name entry. b. Open a shell or command prompt and enter the following: cd <HTTPSERVER_HOME>ant -f webAppConfig.xml -DappName=<windchill-web-app>-Dresource=sslClientAuth -DresourceAuthType=sslClientAuth addAuthResource . For example, ant -f webAppConfig.xml -DappName=Windchill -Dresource=sslClientAuth -DresourceAuthType=sslClientAuthaddAuthResource . 4. Configure PTC HTTP server to require a verifiable client certificate for all request URI\u2019s including sslClientAuth . a. Open <HTTPSERVER_HOME>/conf/conf.d/30-app-<windchill-web-app>-1Auth.conf . b. Update or add if not found at the end of the file, a LocationMatch for sslClientAuth with the following options: # SSL client certification authenticated resources <IfModule ssl_module> <LocationMatch ^/+Windchill/+sslClientAuth(;.*)?> Require all granted SSLVerifyClient require SSLVerifyDepth 10 SSLRenegBufferSize 1048600000 SSLOptions +ExportCertData </LocationMatch> </IfModule> SSLVerifyDepth 10 is added to specify the number of certificates allowed in a client certificate chain to be verified by the Apache server. 5. Configuring PTC FlexPLM for Publishing server. a. To configure FlexPLM for the Design Suite Publishing server, you must register the Publishing server URL with FlexPLM. Run the following command in Windchill shell: ant -f RFAInstaller2.xml addPublishingServerConfiguration -DpublishingServerKeyName=com.flexplm.aiPublishingServer.defaultKey -DpublishingServerUrl=https://<Publishing server IP> -DpublishingServerCredentials=<Publishing server Login user/Password> where <Publishing server IP> is the IP address/host name of the Publishing server and the <Publishing server Login user/Password> are the login credentials that are set on the Publishing server. b.

If you used a context other than <Windchill> during installation, if you used a different LDAP setup during installation, or if you must use the legacy image URL /LCSWImages alias, review the HTTPServer/conf/conf.d/30-app-RFA-Auth.conf configuration file. This ensures that the settings are correct before you log on to PTC FlexPLM for the first time using a browser. For more information, see the Additional Configuration for Nonstandard Installations section. To use load balancing or a cluster configuration, see Modifying Configuration Files for Development, Testing, and\nProduction . Running the Automated Installer To use the automated installer, run the script: <Windchill> /src/com/lcs/build/installer/install.bat or <Windchill> /src/com/lcs/build/installer/install.sh 1. Ensure that the install.bat or install.sh script has the <Windchill> variable set or make sure that the variable is already present in your system environment. 2. The script performs all steps in this document to set up PTC FlexPLM for you. You are prompted to enter information during the installation such as the Windchill web admin username and the Windchill installation db password. When the script has finished, exit the installer and then try to log on. If you are unable to log on to PTC FlexPLM , ensure that the PTC HTTP Server settings are correct. \u25e6 If you are using a nonstandard out-of-the-box configuration of PTC HTTP Server that is supplied with Windchill , select n (No) during the installation when the installer asks, \u201cDo you want to configure PTC HTTP Server ?\u201d After PTC FlexPLM has been fully installed, see the Additional Configuration for Nonstandard Installations section to finish configuring the web server. \u25e6 If you are creating the database schema manually because you are creating it from another server, if it has already been created, or if you are using a different user with special permissions, pause the installer when it asks \u201cDo you want to build the DB schema for PTC FlexPLM now?\u201d While the installer is paused, review the Creating Database Tables, Views, Sequences, and Base Data section. Create the db schema, and then go back to the automated installer and select n (No) so that the installer skips this step and continues the installation. 3. After the installation is complete, see Additional Configuration for Nonstandard Installations and Modifying Configuration Files for Development, Testing, and\nProduction for other possible configuration options. These options include the following: \u25e6 Nonstandard web server configurations (Unix/Windows) \u25e6 Nonstandard servlet engine configurations (Unix/Windows) \u25e6 Clustering \u25e6 Nonstandard Windchill content name \u25e6 Discussion configurations \u25e6 Nonstandard Help Center configurations (Unix/Windows) When you install Windchill PDMLink using the PTC Solution Installer, you are presented with an option to retrieve licenses online or import a license file.

Failure to do this results in incompatible data in the database, vault, and LDAP backups. \u2022 Practice the update multiple times until there are no errors before attempting the production update. \u2022 Include post-update user testing (and even malicious user testing). This testing is critical, because many issues are discovered after the test system is updated during user testing. \u2022 Identify issues before a production update to increase user acceptance and reduce downtime. \u2022 Incorporate time (many weeks) into your update plan for troubleshooting issues and patch delivery. \u2022 Do not make any changes to the system during the update. This includes applying patches or additional maintenance releases. \u2022 Do not change hardware during the update. This introduces additional risk and difficulty in troubleshooting update issues. \u2022 Perform the test update on one server that contains both a test source installation and a test target installation.

For more information about the products supported with this release, see the software matrix (that are available from https://www.ptc.com/en/support/refdoc ) \u25e6 Appropriate language, if using localized PTC FlexPLM \u25e6 Windchill Help Center installed and configured \u25e6 ImageMagick (See the ImageMagick for PTC FlexPLM for installation and configuration details.) In addition, when installing Windchill PDMLink , you can enable extended character sets by selecting the appropriate checkbox. This setting allows you to use languages other than English. You can verify the use of extended character sets by checking the wt.db.maxBytesPerChar setting. \u2022 PTC FlexPLM system environment is running with a single method server. To import or retrieve your FlexPLM licence, see the \u201c PTC FlexPLM Licensing\u201d section in the PTC FlexPLM Help center. \u2022 WinZip or Zip Compression Tool for UNIX is installed. \u2022 To manage CAD data or part structures, you must deploy and install the RFA GWT modules using the readme instructions provided in the RFA GWT CD or ZIP file. \u25e6 You can obtain this file from the PTC software download site and PTC Technical Support. The RFA GWT modules are part of the ZIP file that contains the full PTC FlexPLM download. To follow best practices before you install or update FlexPLM, see Installing a PTC FlexPLM Patch section. \u25e6 These modules are optional and can be installed and deployed at a later time if needed. \u2022 If Windchill PDMLink was installed with an Oracle database using extended multi-byte characters, use the <Windchill> \\db\\sql3 folder for all SQL scripts. If multi-byte characters were not installed, use the <Windchill> \\db\\sql folder for all SQL scripts, which is for non\u2011extended multi-byte characters. To determine which characters were used during installation, check the wt.db.maxBytesPerChar setting. \u25e6 If this setting is set to 1 , then extended multi-byte characters are not enabled and you must use the <Windchill> \\db\\sql folder. \u25e6 If it is set to 3 , then extended multi-byte characters are enabled, and you must use the <Windchill> \\db\\sql3 folder. The SQL folder is represented as sql* throughout this document and represents the appropriate folder for your installation. \u2022 If Windchill PDMLink was installed with a SQL server, use the <Windchill> \\db\\sqlserver folder for all SQL scripts. \u2022 The JVM time zone for the Embedded Servlet Engine and Windchill instances must be set to GMT time, as all data is saved as GMT. The date and time displayed in the user interface is based on the user\u2019s browser locale. Only the JVM for the PTC FlexPLM instance must be modified. Do not modify the JVM for the entire server, as this interferes with other applications. PTC FlexPLM is configured out-of-the-box to force GMT time zones at the persistence layer. \u2022 New installations must use modeled sequences. Using the com.lcs.wc.db.useModeledSequences=false property setting on new installations is unsupported and causes an error. This property is provided for backwards compatibility. Only apply this property to upgraded systems that contain non-modeled sequences in historical Oracle databases. Non-modeled sequences are not supported in SQL server databases. Was this helpful?

            "title": "Creating Role-Based Home Pages",
            "information": "Creating Role-Based Home Pages The only role available in the home page after installing PTC FlexPLM is the default role. To configure additional custom roles, the administrator overrides the out-of-the-box configuration file by creating a custom version of the file. You can configure as many unique layouts for the home page as needed. You can associate each layout to a specific profile representing the set of roles that make sense for the business users of the system. Creating Custom Role-Based Home Pages To create custom role-based home pages in PTC FlexPLM : 1. Create a PDMLink profile and add users or groups to it. Make note of the name you give the profile. You will use it in a later step to associate the profile to a home page layout. 2. To override the default configuration file, tell the system to load the custom configuration file you are about to create. Open the <Windchill> \\codebase\\FlexPLM.xconf file and locate the following entry: <Property name=\"com.ptc.layout.configurableview. configurableViewDefinitionXMLFile\" default=\"/codebase/ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml\" targetFile=\"codebase/wt.properties\"/> 3. Copy the entry from step 2 into the clipboard. 4. Open the <Windchill> \\site.xconf file and add the entry by pasting from the clipboard into a place near the end of the file. 5. Change the entry so that it reflects the custom filename. Example to add to site.xconf : <Property name=\"com.ptc.layout.configurableview. configurableViewDefinitionXMLFile\" default=\"/codebase/ custom .ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml\" targetFile=\"codebase/wt.properties\"/> 6. To create the custom file, copy <Windchill> \\codebase\\ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml to <Windchill> \\codebase\\custom.ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml . 7. Alter custom.ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml to create the set of custom profiles and layouts for each custom profile to satisfy the roles that your business users assume. The following example calls out the configurable elements used to define a new layout and associate the layout to a role profile. In your custom.ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml file, use the following elements to define the custom layouts you need and associate them to the roles your business users assume when using the PTC FlexPLM system: \u25e6 Define a layoutProfileMapping element for each unique role profile defined in the system. Note that the same layout can be assigned to one or more profiles. <layoutProfileMapping profile='default_oob_profile' layout='standardLayout'/> <layoutProfileMapping profile='vendor_oob_profile' layout='standardVendorLayout'/> <layoutProfileMapping profile='sourcingManager' layout='sourcingLayout'/> \u25e6 Define a layoutDefinition element to identify each unique layout available in the system. The name of the layout is used in the layoutProfileMapping entry when associating a layout to a role profile. <layoutDefinition name='standardVendorLayout'> \u25e6 Each layoutDefinition is made up of one or more column definitions. Use the column width to help control the overall page width. <column width='500'> \u25e6 Each column can contain components. A component is literally a page or report. <component> \u25e6 ID is the actual activity name to use. <id>NOTICES</id> In activityControllerMappings.properties , the NOTICES activity links to an activity in a specific controller. \u25e6 Use the params element to define any request parameters you want to pass to the report. This is useful for different layouts, where the same report can be used but you can trigger different views in the report based on the parameters passed to it. Also, different layouts can pass different parameters. <params> \u25e6 In this example, templateType is the actual request parameter being passed on the request to the page/report. <templateType>COMPONENT</templateType> Example of a custom.ConfigurableView_Definitions.xml file: <layoutProfileMapping profile='default_oob_profile' layout='standardLayout'/> <layoutProfileMapping profile='vendor_oob_profile' layout='standardVendorLayout'/> <layoutProfileMapping profile='sourcingManager' layout='sourcingLayout'/> <layoutDefinition name='standardVendorLayout'> <column width='500'> <component> <id>NOTICES</id> <params> <templateType>COMPONENT</templateType> </params> </component> <component> <id>ORDER_CONFIRMATION_SUMMARY</id> <params> <templateType>COMPONENT</templateType> </params> </component> <component> <id>PRODUCT_SAMPLE_SUMMARY</id> <params> <templateType>COMPONENT</templateType> </params> </component> </column> <column width='500'> <component> <id>SEASON_SUMMARY</id> <params> </params> </component> <component> <id>RFQ_SUMMARY</id> <params> </params> </component> <component> <id>MATERIAL_SAMPLE_SUMMARY</id> <params> <templateType>COMPONENT</templateType> </params> </component> </column> </layoutDefinition> Was this helpful?

            "information": "Role-Based Homepage Configuration Windchill supports the concept of role-based home pages, which allow you to create profiles for user groups that control how the application appears to users, based on their role within the system. Profiles turn the role-based home page components on and off. These components provide quick access to the most commonly needed areas of the system, and are configured by administrators. The following components are available: \u2022 Notices Dashboard (includes internal and vendor notices) \u2022 Season Dashboard \u2022 RFQ Dashboard \u2022 Order Confirmation Dashboard \u2022 Material Sample Dashboard \u2022 Product Sample Dashboard The role-based home page dashboards include a number of lists and a pie chart. You can select the information displayed and how it is grouped by making selections from the lists and clicking Run . The system updates the pie chart for that dashboard, giving you visibility to grouped and filtered data sets with minimal clicks. You can hover over sections of the pie chart to view summary information about that section. Clicking a pie section takes you to the line sheet or search results represented by the selected data. If you have configured the Vendor Portal, you can also use the role-based home pages for your vendor users. Perform the same types of configuration steps outlined in this document to define additional layouts for the various profiles (roles) that your vendor users would play in the system. Role-based home pages can provide vendors with quick access to various system objects including seasonal products, RFQs, order confirmations, and samples. You can select different role-based home page layouts by selecting from the Profiles list on the home page. If cookies are enabled in your browser, the system stores your profile selection, and automatically loads it the next time you log on to the system. You can configure filters for each role-based home page component; other aspects are hard-coded and cannot be changed. Filter configuration is discussed in the next section. Was this helpful?

Navigate to the following path: <Windchill> /codebase/com/lcs/ b. Delete the wc directory and all subdirectories. By deleting the wc directory, you ensure that the old binary files and any duplicate files are removed before the new version of PTC FlexPLM is applied. If you have customizations under <Windchill> /codebase/com/lcs/wc , such as <Windchill> /codebase/com/lcs/wc/client/*custom*.mappings.properties , reapply them. c. Navigate to the following path: <Windchill> /codebase d. Delete the rfa folder. By deleting the rfa directory, you ensure that old files and any duplicate files are removed before the new build of PTC FlexPLM is applied. If you have customizations under <Windchill> /codebase/rfa , such as <Windchill> /codebase/rfa/customFolder.jsp , reapply them. 2. Expand the FlexPLM.zip file. a. Open the JAR file with Winzip.exe or a ZIP compression tool for UNIX. b. Extract all of the files to <Windchill> . Do not extract to the codebase folder. You must overwrite folders with the same structure. For example, extract to a temporary folder c:\\temp\\flexplm123\\ . The structure might look like the following examples: \u25aa c:\\temp\\flexplm123\\codebase \u25aa c:\\temp\\flexplm123\\web-root Copy the actual codebase folder to the root <Windchill> folder. 3. Purge the Embedded Servlet Engine cache: a. Shut down Windchill . b. Navigate to the following path: <Windchill> /tomcat c. Expand the Work directory under the following path: <Windchill> /tomcat/instances/instance-***/ d. Delete the contents of the Work directory. 4. Run the automated installer script. To run the automated installer, you must have already run the Windchill update tool. Also, if you must update to a new MOR, apply the MOR before you update PTC FlexPLM . After the automated installer is finished, the system is completely configured for basic PTC FlexPLM functionality. To use the automated installer, do the following: a. Run one of the following scripts: <Windchill> /src/com/lcs/build/installer/install.bat <Windchill> /src/com/lcs/build/installer/install.sh b. Ensure that the install.bat or install.sh script has the <Windchill> variable set. If it is not set, then the variable must already be set in your system environment. c. The script performs all steps to set up PTC FlexPLM for you. You are prompted to enter information during the installation, such as the Windchill web admin username. When the script has finished, exit the installer and then log on to PTC FlexPLM . If you are unable to log on to PTC FlexPLM , ensure that the PTC HTTP Server settings are correct. If you are using a nonstandard out-of-the-box configuration of PTC HTTP Server that is supplied with Windchill , answer n (No) during the installation when the installer asks, \u201cDo you want to configure PTC HTTP Server ?\u201d After PTC FlexPLM has been fully installed, see the Additional Configuration for Nonstandard Installations section to finish configuring the web server. d. After the installation is complete, see Additional Configuration for Nonstandard Installations and Modifying Configuration Files for Development, Testing, and\nProduction for other possible configuration options including the following: \u25aa Nonstandard web server configurations (Unix/Windows) \u25aa Nonstandard servlet engine configurations (Unix/Windows) \u25aa Clustering \u25aa Nonstandard Windchill context name configurations \u25aa Discussion configurations \u25aa Nonstandard Help Center configurations (Unix/Windows) 5.

Property Name Description jsp.season.colorwaymanager.maxproducts=30 Defines the maximum number of products that can be selected when using the colorway manager. Increasing this number allows more products to be selected, but can make the page hard to use, as the products scroll to the right. Additionally, more products have a detrimental effect on performance in both the loading of the page as well the use of the checkboxes within the page. Save actions also take longer with more product/color changes being affected. jsp.season.colorwaymanager.ColorAttributes=type,name,colorchip Defines which color attributes are displayed for the colors on the Colorway Manager page. The attributes must be defined at the root color type before they can be included. Adding an attribute not defined at the root type causes an exception. The list must be comma separated and contain the keys of the attributes to include. The exceptions are type which includes the PTC FlexPLM type, and colorchip which shows the RGB value or thumbnail if the color has one. The order in which the attributes are specified is the order in which the attributes are displayed. jsp.season.colorwaymanager.ProductMinColumnWidths=15 Defines the width of each product column within the Colorway Manager page. Changing this property increases or decreases the minimum width of the Product columns. If a product name is longer than the given width, the name wraps as allowed by the individual browser. If the name cannot wrap, the column width is forced to be wider than the specified value. The number is approximately the number of characters that fits in the column. jsp.season.colorwaymanager.repeatHeaderNumberofRows=30 Defines how many rows appear before the header repeats on the Colorway Manager page. Depending on the intended size of page and typical resolution, increase or decrease this number appropriately. The default setting is 30. Based on a screen resolution of 1280x1024 at full screen, a typical table shows 30 rows. Set the value to 0 to prevent the header from repeating. Was this helpful?

When viewing the cost sheet from the line sheet, you can apply mass edits or do a search and replace to cost sheet attributes. You can use the line sheet to view and edit data from various business objects, including attributes for the following types: \u2022 Product \u2022 Colorway \u2022 Product Season Link \u2022 Colorway-Season Link \u2022 Sourcing Configuration \u2022 Sourcing Configuration to Season \u2022 Season Group \u2022 Season Group to Product \u2022 Season Group to Colorway \u2022 Material \u2022 Material Supplier \u2022 Placeholder Uploading Colorway Thumbnails You can upload colorway thumbnails directly to the line sheet. You can also upload files using drag and drop. Acceptable file formats are JPEG, PNG, JPG, GIF, and BMP. Updating Attribute Values You can update editable attribute values in the line sheet cells. The system displays the current value. To change a value, click into the cell and make the appropriate edits. Changed values are marked with a modified value indicator, illustrated by a small red triangle in the top left corner of the cell. If a changed attribute is a part of a formula and its resultant numeric attribute is defined in your View , the value of the resultant attribute is re-calculated and updated dynamically. For details, refer to the \u201cRe-calculating Updated Attribute Values\u201d section below. After you have completed your updates, click Save to save your changes and remain in the edit mode. \u2022 If you click Cancel before saving your changes, a warning appears that you lose any unsaved changes if you proceed. \u2022 The ability to edit attribute values in the line sheet is configured by an administrator using the Type and Attribute Management utility. Re-calculating Updated Attribute Values When you edit a line sheet to update any cost sheet attributes, and if these attributes are used in calculating any formulae, the value of their resultant attribute is dynamically re-calculated. You can observe this change only when all the updated attributes are defined in your line sheet view. To understand the above scenario, consider the following example: \u2022 A, B, and C are cost sheet attributes and they are defined in the line sheet view. \u2022 A, B, and C exist on the same object, which is a cost sheet object. \u2022 A, B, and C are a part of the formula below, where A and B are driving attributes and C is the calculated attribute. A + B = C When you update the value of A, the value of C is dynamically re-calculated. The updated values are marked with an indicator. All pre-derive and post-derive server side plug-ins are also included in the dynamic re-calculation. Navigating Between Views If you apply filters, lock or unlock columns, show or hide columns, move columns, apply a sort, or run line sheet options, the system saves your formatting options when you do the following: \u2022 Switch between view and edit mode \u2022 Switch between freeze pane and other modes \u2022 Navigate to a different line sheet of the same product type \u2022 Navigate to a different line sheet with a different product type when both line sheets have the same view, and that view is selected in the destination line sheet (The view must have the same view name and view object.) The changes apply until you clear the browser cache, update the view, or click Revert to View . Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

In 11.1 M010 release and later, all PTC FlexPLM logging capabilities are migrated to Log4j. To manage logging, you must be familiar with the information in the list below: \u2022 The property settings that affect PTC FlexPLM specialized logging that are in the lcs.properties file. For detailed information, refer to the \u201c PTC FlexPLM Specialized Loggers\u201d section. \u2022 General information about the Log4j package. The following URL takes you to an introduction to Log4j: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html \u2022 The Log4j loggers that are used for PTC FlexPLM logging. Logger names are intended to be meaningful without requiring documentation and refer to an area of product functionality or to a Java package or class. For general debug logging rely on Java package or class names. For specialized PTC FlexPLM logs LCSQueryLog , LCSAccessLog , LCSErrorLog , LCSLinePlan log refer to the default Log4j configurations found in the log4jMethodServer.properties file. For detailed information, refer to the \u201c PTC FlexPLM Specialized Loggers\u201d section. \u2022 The property settings that affect Log4j logging. These property settings are in the properties files located in <Windchill>/codebase/WEB-INF \u25e6 log4jMethodServer.properties \u2014Controls the method server Log4j logging and the logging for the PTC FlexPLM web applications that run in the Tomcat servlet engine that is embedded in the method server. \u25e6 To implement changes to the log4j properties files that are listed previously, you must edit the files instead of using the xconfmanager command line utility. If you make any manual changes to these files ensure that you first back up the files. \u2022 How to view or send Log4j log files. There are multiple ways to view or send Log4j log files. See the examples below. \u25e6 Collect log files using the System Configuration Collector that is available in Windchill Site > Utilities . For more information, see \u201cSystem Configuration Collector\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . \u25e6 Open the Log File Viewer page to search, list, and view server log files. On the Server Status page, click Monitoring Tools to open the System Health Monitoring Tools page and the click Log File Viewer . For more information, see. \u201cServer Status\u201d in Windchill . \u2022 How to display or set log levels. There are multiple methods available for setting log levels: \u25e6 Use the wt.util.jmx.SetLogLevel command-line utility to set or reset logger verbosity levels for specified loggers in specified server processes. The utility is specified as follows: java wt.util.jmx.SetLogLevel [-ms|-sm|-se|-all]* [-resetAll] [<logger_name> [<log_level>]] Here, <logger_name> is the name of the logger, and <log_level> is the specified verbosity level. Valid values for log level are: ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, and OFF. You can specify the server processes using any combination of the following: \u25aa -sm \u2014 Targets all server managers in the cluster. \u25aa -ms \u2014 Targets all method servers in the cluster, including those with and without embedded servlet engines. \u25aa -se \u2014 Targets all servlet engines in the cluster. \u25aa -all \u2014 Targets all of the above processes. If you do not specify a value, information is displayed for all of the above processes. The - resetAll option resets all log4j verbosities in the target processes to the level specified by the log4j configuration file. If both - resetAll and a logger name are specified, the reset is performed before setting the specified logger's verbosity level. You must specify either - resetAll or a logger name. \u25e6 The Log Levels link on the System Health Monitoring Tools page in Windchill presents a page from which you can display or set log levels for server manager, method server, or servlet engine loggers for current server processes. For more information on getting the Log Levels links, see \u201cUsing the Monitoring Tools\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . You must enable certain logging functions only for troubleshooting purposes. For more information, see \u201cBest Practices for Securing Your Windchill Solution\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . PTC FlexPLM Specialized Loggers LCSQueryLog*/ LCSSlowQueryLog* \u2022 This log4j appender is configured for DEBUG level out of the box. It is used to log all PTC FlexPLM database SQL Select statements. Using the optional slow query appender you can log queries that exceed a configured threshold ( com.lcs.wc.util.LCSQueryLog.slowLoggingThreshold=500 specified in milliseconds) to a separate file. \u2022 You can use this log as a reference to investigate PTC FlexPLM query performance that is related to actions that specific users undertake. Additionally, you can use it to identify the specific API call that generates a specific query by enabling TRACE level logging. \u2022 As configured out of the box, certain log4j entries are added to codebase\\WEB-INF\\log4jMethodServer.properties . These settings are typical development system settings. You may want to modify these settings in your production environments to ERROR level to disable the more verbose DEBUG settings for these loggers. \u2022 These logs are configured out of the box to roll over on a daily basis or when the default size threshold (9 MB) is reached to support archiving logs similar to the MethodServer logs. LCSErrorLog \u2022 This log4j appender is configured for ERROR level out of the box. It is used to log full stacktraces for exceptions that occur in the product to the LCSError*log . \u2022 You can use this log as a reference to navigate to recent exceptions. \u2022 As configured out of the box, certain log4j entries are added to codebase\\WEB-INF\\log4jMethodServer.properties . These settings are typical system settings. \u2022 This log is configured out of the box to roll over to new log files daily when the default size threshold (9 MB) is reached to support archiving logs like the Method Server logs. LCSLinePlanLog \u2022 This log4j appender is configured for DEBUG level out of the box. It is used to track the performance of line sheet actions that a user performs. \u2022 You can use this log as a reference to navigate and to debug user actions that are related to line sheet and line sheet performance. \u2022 As configured out of the box, certain log4j entries are added to codebase\\WEB-INF\\log4jMethodServer.properties . These settings are typical development system settings. You may want to modify these settings in your production environments to ERROR level to disable DEBUG settings for these loggers. \u2022 This log is configured out of the box to roll over on a daily basis or when the default size threshold (9 MB) is reached to support archiving logs similar to the Method Server logs. LCSAccessLog*/LCSAccessEntryLog* \u2022 These log4j logfile appenders are configured for INFO level and ERROR level out of the box. They are used to track user actions on the client side. The ERROR level logging for the entry logging disables the \u201centry\u201d logging. While the INFO level for the access log, is required to allow the User Access Log Stats feature to have data to report on. \u2022 The access log writes a single entry for every server completed activity. For example, a request is made, and satisfied by the server. The time that it took the server to satisfy the request for the action performed by the user is logged. The access entry log if enabled by setting log level to INFO will log the start of every request to the server. If you enable this appender, you can identify failed user activities. The output is written to separate files. \u2022 As configured out of the box, certain log4j entries are added to codebase\\WEB-INF\\log4jMethodServer.properties . These settings are typical system settings. You must not modify the log4j logger log level for the LCSAccessLog appender. If you disable this appender, you cannot generate User Access Log Stats reports. \u2022 This log is configured out of the box to roll over to the new log files daily to support archiving logs like the Method Server logs.

For more information, see \u201cMeasurement Set: FitSpec\u201d and \u201cMeasurement Set: Grades\u201d in Reports . Relationship to Samples Measurement sets are used in the creation of a fit sample. Samples require you to select from a source and specification combination. Measurement sets that exist for the given combination are in turn used to generate the fit information for the sample set, providing size, placement, and tolerance information, as well as how to measure instructions. Updated fit sample information might also update the measurement set. For more details on working with samples, see Samples . Relationship to Bill of Materials Product sizing and the size category are two of the five existing bill of material (BOM) variations. The size category dictates which sizes are available for the given BOM, and the sizes in turn might affect any size overrides that exist for the BOM. For more information on BOMs, see Bill of Materials . Relationship to Cost Sheet Product sizing and the size category are also used in the cost sheet. Users can specify for which size category and related sizes they want to generate an active or what if cost sheet, and then select a representative size for use in calculations. If a BOM roll-up customization exists, then product sizing and size category cost values can be used when calculating total cost sheet value. For more information on cost sheets, see Costing .

The measurement table defaults to the Measurement Set values. Both measurement templates and product measurement sets also display the current grade rules when you click Grade Rules button. Clicking on the Grade Rules/Measurements toggles the table to display grade rules and Measurement set values respectively. Click the name of the column to sort the contents in alphabetical or numerical order. Clicking the name of a sorted column reverses the sort order. To update information in the table, select the table cell and enter the updates. Click Save or Save & Check In to apply the changes. The Measurement Set The Measurement Set displays all of the points of measure contained within the measurement template or product measurement set. For information on using the icons in the Measurement Set , see Icons in the Measurement Table Editor . The Measurement Set includes the following columns: Column Description Select Contains a checkbox for each point of measure (POM). The checkboxes in this column are used in conjunction with the measurement table editor icons. Insert Click the icon to insert rows, delete rows, copy rows, or paste grade rules. POM # Displays the POM number, if one has been assigned. Name Displays the name of the POM. Placement Amount Displays the numeric value of the placement amount for the POM. This column is used with the Placement Reference column. Placement Reference Provides information about how and where to measure the POM. This column is used with the Placement Amount column. Criticality If applicable, displays the assigned criticality value for the POM when the point of measure was created (either critical, detail, or secondary). Section If applicable, displays the section to which the POM is assigned. Tol (+) and Tol (-) Display the numeric values for POM tolerances. The measurement and grade rule template tables can include an HTM Instruction column, which displays any how-to-measure information entered in the HTM Instruction field for the measurement template. For product measurement sets, the table displays a column for each size that belongs to the product measurement set and the corresponding value for each POM and size combination. The Grade Rules The Grade Rules displays all of the grade rules contained within the grade rule template or product measurement set. The Grade Rules contains the same columns as the Measurement Set . The Grade Rule Increment column on the Grade Rules allows you to enter a grade rule that is applied to all sizes for the given POM. The way the increment is applied depends on the grading method you selected when you created the grade rule template. Enter a numerical value in the Grade Rule Increment column for the given POM. Click the apply increment icon to apply the grade rule value to all sizes for the given POM. The system automatically updates the grade rule value for each size, based on the grading method. Grading Method Application Incremental Sizes increase by the specified increment, based on the value of the previous size, working away from the base size. Relative Sizes increase by the specified increment, based on the value of the base size and their location in the table relative to the base size, working away from the base size. The grading method does not affect the way the measurement values are displayed in the measurement table. The measurement values for both incremental and relative are the same. The difference is in the way they are calculated. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

To allow other users to update specific sizes, you must use two property settings. The first property setting, jsp.measurements.useTemplateLocks , must be changed to true to enable this functionality. jsp.measurements.use.TemplateLocks= true The value of the second property can vary based on the sizes you want to allow users to edit. jsp.measurements.productGroup.editableSizeRunSizes= <value> This property setting controls the editing of specific sizes in product measurement sets only. It does not control the editing of specific sizes in templates. The jsp.measurements.useTemplateLocks property is set to false out-of-the-box to disable the function. jsp.measurements.useTemplateLocks= false By default, only administrators can update all sizes. Non-administrators cannot update product measurement sizes out-of-the-box, as no sizes are set as values for the second property setting listed above. To enable this functionality, you must first set the jsp.measurements.useTemplateLocks property to true . This enables the use of the second property setting. jsp.measurements.useTemplateLocks= true You must also specify which sizes you want to allow non-administrators to edit. Enter each size as a value of the property setting, separated by the following separator: pipe, tilde, asterisk, tilde, pipe |~*~| As there are no defaults for this property setting, if you want all users to be able to edit all product measurement size values, you must enter all possible sizes as values. Entering select values allows non-administrators to edit those size values only. jsp.measurements.productGroup.editableSizeRunSizes=S|~*~|M|~*~|L|~*~|XL|~*~|0|~*~|2|~*~|4|~*~|6|~*~|8|~*~|10 In this example, non-administrators can edit the following sizes: S, M, L, XL, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Any other sizes are unavailable for edit to non-administrators. Enabling Sizing for Multiple Cost Sheets You can control whether or not the sizing variation is available when creating or editing cost sheets using two property settings. The first property setting, com.lcs.wc.product.useSizing , must be set to true to enable product sizing. When this property is set to true , the following property setting controls whether or not the product sizing variation appears in the cost sheet: com.lcs.wc.sourcing.costSheet.useMultiCostSizing= <value> You can use the product sizing variation with multiple cost sheets out-of-the-box. The default value for this property setting is true . com.lcs.wc.sourcing.costSheet.useMultiCostSizing= true If you want to disable the use of product sizing with multiple cost sheets, set the value of this property to false . com.lcs.wc.sourcing.costSheet.useMultiCostSizing= false Was this helpful?

Because all measurement objects are typed collectively, there might be certain attributes groups that apply only to the measurement template, and others that apply only to the measurement set. You can create separate attributes for each area, and add the appropriate attributes to each. For more information, see Editing an Attribute Group . Measurements Types There are two types for measurements: \u2022 Measurements \u2014This type is used to create attributes that are displayed for each POM (point of measure), in tabular form. Examples of these attributes Measurements include Criticality or Comments . \u2022 Measurements POM \u2014This type contains attributes that apply to the measurement templates or sets as a whole. Examples of these attributes include UOM (unit of measure) and Grading Method . The Header Attributes on the product measurement set display measurement attributes on the Measurements POM type. Out-of-the-Box Attributes You can change the out-of-the-box values for attributes by selecting Administrative > Type and Attribute Management from the side navigation bar. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, select the attribute and go into edit mode. \u2022 For more information on managing attributes, see Attributes Tab and Attribute Information Page . \u2022 For more information on out-of-the-box attributes, see Out-of-the-Box Attributes Supported by PTC FlexPLM . Attribute Type Description measurementsName Measurements POM Text attribute that allows you to specify the name of product measurement sets, measurement templates, and grade rule templates. criticalPOM Measurements A single list attribute that creates the different levels of criticality for POMs. Each level of criticality is a value in the single list. The default values for the attribute are critical, detail, and secondary. This attribute also allows you to specify a color that is automatically used to highlight those POMs in the measurement table that match the corresponding level of criticality. The available values for POM highlighting are: \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_YELLOW \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_ORANGE \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_GREEN \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_BLUE \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_PINK \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_ROSE \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_PALEBLUE \u2022 HIGHLIGHT_PURPLE gradingMethod Measurements POM A single list attribute that creates the different grading methods for grade rule templates. Each grading method is a value in the single list. The out-of-the-box values for this attribute are relative and incremental. It is not advisable to change the attribute values. htmInstruction Measurements A text area that allows you to enter how to measure information for a given POM. In conjunction with the howToMeasure attribute, this provides detailed measuring instructions to users. measurementName Measurements A text attribute that allows you to specify the name of a POM. plusTolerance Measurements A float attribute that allows users to enter a numerical value for the upper range of tolerance for a POM. minusTolerance Measurements A float attribute that allows users to enter a numerical value for the lower range of tolerance for a POM. number Measurements A text attribute that allows users to create identifying POM numbers. Because it is a text field, identifying POM numbers can also include alphabetical characters. howToMeasure Measurements An image attribute that allows you to associate an image to a POM, typically providing how to measure information to other users. When used in conjunction with the htmInstruction attribute, this attribute provides detailed measuring instructions to users. placementAmount Measurements A single list attribute that allows you to define the values that are available when specifying the placement amount for a POM. The attribute value for the placementAmount attribute is used in conjunction with the value of the placementReference attribute to provide detailed information to the user about where the measurement is taken from. placementReference Measurements A single list attribute that allows you to define the values that are available when specifying the placement reference for a POM. Examples of placement reference list values include \u201cFrom Top of Waistband,\u201d \u201cBelow Rise,\u201d or \u201cAt Center Front.\u201d section Measurements A single list attribute that allows you to define the available sections for POM groupings. Examples of section values include \u201cArmhole,\u201d \u201cLeg,\u201d and \u201cWaist.\u201d uom Measurements POM A single list attribute that allows you to define the available unit of measures for POM values. For more information, see Unit of Measure . Attribute Display All attributes created on the measurement object are available in all parts of the system that involve measurements. These areas include the POM library, measurement templates, grade rule templates, product measurement sets, and fit samples. These attributes are also available in the specification. Some are available out-of-the-box, while others might require customization to appear. The display of attributes in the system is controlled through the Type and Attribute Management utility. You can control which attributes are displayed in which areas of the system. Examples include sample comments versus how to measure comments, or sample delta values, which you might only want to view, create, or update in sample forms. Was this helpful?

            "title": "Measurements Hierarchy",
            "information": "Measurements Hierarchy All measurement objects are typed using the same measurement hierarchy. Because measurements vary from one size market to another, companies commonly create types based on market. If there is substantial variation from brand to brand, you might also want to create types that represent the different brands. You can also use these types to control security. The size category, full size range, and actual size range objects do not respect typing; they all exist at the root level. However, both measurement and grade rule templates currently use the same types and attributes that are defined using the Type and Attribute Management utility. The measurement type is referenced by the product object. When you create product measurement sets, you must select a measurement type to filter both the measurement and grade rule templates that are available for measurement set creation. You can control which types are available through the Type and Attribute Management utility.

            "title": "Overview of PTC FlexPLM",
            "information": "Overview of PTC FlexPLM Product development is a complex process. Outsourcing, globalization, the Internet, and a strong customer focus all add to our existing intense time and cost pressures. As a result, the product development process must now engage a variety of cross-functional participants in a value chain that includes developers, suppliers, partners, and customers in multiple geographic locations. The most efficient way to control this process is by using a product lifecycle management (PLM) system to manage products from concept through the end of life. PLM has gained wide acceptance as the primary means to improve product development processes across the product development chain. PLM is unique from other enterprise systems you might have used or encountered, because it is about products, not transactions. It should be viewed simply as an extension of your company\u2019s existing enterprise transaction infrastructure. PLM gives people at all levels and functions in the organization the ability to: \u2022 Create digital representations of products \u2022 Collaborate cross-functionally in an organization and throughout the product chain \u2022 Control and manage product information and product development processes throughout the product\u2019s lifecycle PLM in the Retail, Footwear, and Apparel Industry The retail, footwear, and apparel (RFA) product development process is fundamentally different than that of discrete manufacturing, which has driven the development of traditional PLM. The RFA industry\u2019s volatile supply chains require a different form of PLM flexibility. Retail, footwear, and apparel product designs are intensely driven by emotional concepts and decisions, fashion trends, material innovation, and new fabric technology\u2014development considerations not taken into account in manufacturing-driven PLM methodologies. Traditional PLM offerings have not adequately addressed the collaborative and creative nature of the retail, footwear, and apparel industry. The illustration below shows the complexity of the RFA value chain. In a non-PLM development process, there are numerous points of communication with limited process visibility. The process is not centralized, resulting in multiple versions of a product, needless duplication of effort, and an overall lack of control of the process. Benefits of PTC FlexPLM PTC FlexPLM , in conjunction with Windchill technology, was developed specifically to address the needs of the RFA industry. PTC FlexPLM addresses the four most important retail, footwear, and apparel initiatives: \u2022 Reduce Time to Market\u2014With PTC FlexPLM , everyone in the product life cycle process is a player. Having everyone involved improves collaboration with vendors, reduces the number of specification changes, and improves your design productivity by including all relevant participants in each stage of the design process. \u2022 Reduce Total Product Cost\u2014Two significant characteristics of the RFA industry are its short product development timeframes and the large aggregation of materials needed to produce a single garment. Couple this with the demand from manufacturers and retailers for earlier and larger commitments of inventory, and cost considerations can be overwhelming. PTC FlexPLM allows an enterprise to reduce the number of samples and to improve design review efficiency. These cost savings can be measured in many areas, including color and fit management, line development, and consumption of raw materials. \u2022 Improve Product Quality\u2014Product quality can often be improved by increased attention to detail. PTC FlexPLM allows precise management of data access and accuracy, adherence to quality standards, and improved control over product specifications. \u2022 Improve Information Exchange\u2014The effective and uncluttered exchange of information is essential to the success and profit of any business. PTC FlexPLM offers the RFA enterprise improved collaboration, both internally and with customers. PTC FlexPLM consolidates the locations of product information to avoid duplication or fault categorization of product data. Additionally, improved collaboration with suppliers and vendors results in more rapid construction times and more accurate product results. With these initiatives in mind, PTC FlexPLM brings process automation control to the dynamic RFA industry. Instead of the scattered and disjointed product development process shown in the previous illustration, PTC FlexPLM brings a structured, centralized, and controlled approach to the RFA enterprise.

Similarly, if you do not select a filter from the Filters menu, the system displays the contents using the filter layout as specified in the Type and Attribute Management utility. These views and filters are different from the default views and filters that are designated manually. Your administrator might create system views and filters, as well as group views and filters. The naming of these views and filters, as well as personal views and filters, is governed by a set of rules. For more information, see Naming Views and Filters . Your administrator might also designate a certain system view or filter as the default view or filter for the entire system. The system automatically selects this view or filter from the available list of views or filters. You can override the default system view or filter by designating your personal view or filter as the default, by selecting the Default View or Default Filter checkbox. Subtypes inherit default views and filters from higher types in the type hierarchy. You can override this inheritance by setting a different view or filter as the default for a particular subtype.

However, the Product/Apparel/Mens type and all of its subtypes ( Product/Apparel/Mens/Active , Product/Apparel/Mens/Career , and Product/Apparel/Mens/Casual ) would now have the Review view or filter as its default.

Creating a Filter Template When creating a filter, you can designate the filter as a template by selecting the Filter Template checkbox when creating the filter. This designation cannot be changed, and you cannot designate a non-template filter as a template filter later. The designation must be made when the filter is created. Filter templates are created and updated in the same manner as non-template filters; however, there are some key differences between a template filter and a non-template filter. \u2022 Users selecting a filter template can change the criteria values. The filter template specifies which attributes to filter on, and automatically enters or selects the value that was selected when the filter was defined; however, filter templates allow you to specify a different criteria value than the default value displayed. \u2022 Non-template filters require you to specify a criteria value for each attribute selected; however, you are not required to enter or select a value for a given attribute in filter templates. If no value is specified when creating the filter template, the system does not display a default value for the attribute when the filter is selected \u2022 You cannot create \u201cor\u201d criteria for all attributes. You can only create \u201cor\u201d criteria for list attributes (composite, single list, or multi-list types). \u2022 You can select the same attribute multiple times; however, each time the attribute is selected, its value replaces the previous values. This eliminates the possibility of \u201cor\u201d criteria, except where noted previously. Updating Filters To update a filter, follow these steps. 1. Select the filter and click the update filter icon . 2. On the Update Search Preference page, add, remove, or reorder the attributes that are already included in the filter. 3. When you are finished selecting and ordering the attributes, click Update to save your changes. 4. Click Return to return to the search page. Sharing Filters The Share Filter function allows you to email the current filter to an individual user, a selected list of PTC FlexPLM users, or a predefined group within your organization. 1. Select the filter and click the update table layout icon . 2. On the Update Search Preference page, click Share Filter . 3. On the Email Client page, complete the information to send the filter.

            "title": "Naming Views and Filters",
            "information": "Naming Views and Filters There are certain rules that govern the naming of views and filters. View and filter names must be unique and adhere to the following naming conventions. Unique Names and the Type Hierarchy Because a view or filter is associated to a specific type in the hierarchy, view and filter names must be unique within the rules of the type hierarchy for each object. If a view or filter is defined for men\u2019s apparel products, the view or filter is tied to the Product/Apparel/Mens type. However, if you search for views or filters against the Product/Apparel/Mens type, the system also displays the views or filters defined at the Product level and the Product/Apparel level, as well as those at the Product/Apparel/Mens type. Because PTC FlexPLM allows for the inheritance of views and filters defined at higher levels in the hierarchy, names must be unique looking up the hierarchy at any branch of which it is a descendant. The subtype Product/Apparel/Mens is a descendant of Product/Apparel , which is a descendant of Product . In addition, because users can create views and filters for subtypes below the Product/Apparel/Mens type, which is also a subtype, the view and filter names must also be unique across all views or filters defined for each of these subtypes, because they are descendants of the Product/Apparel/Mens type. The applicable types in this case are the Product/Apparel/Mens/Active , Product/Apparel/Mens/Career , and Product/Apparel/Mens/Casual . If there were additional types defined below any of the Product/Apparel/Mens subtypes, similar naming rules would apply. Rules governing the naming of sibling nodes, such as Product/Apparel/Mens and Product/Apparel/Womens in the example above, are different. It is not possible for users to simultaneously search both types. Therefore, views or filters defined against the Product/Apparel/Mens type can have the same name as one defined against the Product/Apparel/Womens type. When selecting a subtype of Product/Apparel , you can only select one subtype (either Product/Apparel/Mens , Product/Apparel/Womens , or Product/Apparel/Childrens in the example above). Thus, a view or filter name defined for one type does not have to be unique when compared to the name of views or filters created for the remaining two types. Uniqueness is limited to the branch in the tree to which the type belongs. The following is a graphical tree representation of the example product hierarchy that was provided previously. Dashed black represents the example type, and dark blue represents the types that must have unique names when compared to the dashed black type. Duplicate names are always prohibited within the example type. Given this product hierarchy, the following examples are true. The graphical tree representation is displayed first, and the discussion of it follows. A view or filter name created at the Product/Apparel/Womens type must have a unique name when compared against the names of all views or filters defined at the following levels: \u2022 The Product/Apparel/Womens type itself \u2022 Any type at a higher level that is in a single path. The applicable types in this case are: \u25e6 Product/Apparel \u25e6 Product \u2022 Any type at a lower level that is in a multi-step path. The applicable types in this case are: \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Womens/Active \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Womens/Career \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Womens/Casual A view or filter name created at the Product/Apparel type must have a unique name when compared against the names of all views or filters defined at the following levels: \u2022 The Product/Apparel type itself \u2022 Any type at a higher level that is in a single path. The applicable type in this case would be Product . \u2022 Any type that is directly descended from the Product/Apparel type, as well as its descendants. The applicable types in this case would be all of the following: \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Childrens (and all subtypes; not expanded above) \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Mens (and all subtypes; listed below) \u25aa Product/Apparel/Mens/Active \u25aa Product/Apparel/Mens/Career \u25aa Product/Apparel/Mens/Casual \u25e6 Product/Apparel/Womens (and all subtypes; listed below) \u25aa Product/Apparel/Womens/Active \u25aa Product/Apparel/Womens/Career \u25aa Product/Apparel/Womens/Casual A view or filter name created at the Product/Personal Care type must have a unique name when compared against the names of all views or filters defined at the following levels: \u2022 The Product/Personal Care type itself \u2022 Any type at a higher level that is in a single path. The applicable type in this case would be the Product type. A view or filter name created at the Product type must have a unique name when compared against the names of all views or filters defined at the following levels: \u2022 The Product type itself \u2022 Any type at a lower level that is in a multi-step path. The applicable types in this case would be all product types that are not the Product type. User Views and Filters The following rules are applied when naming a user level view or filter: \u2022 The name must be unique for the specific user\u2019s set of views and filters. \u2022 The name must not exist at the group or system level; however, the name can exist for different users. Group Views and Filters The following rules are applied when naming a group level view or filter: \u2022 The name must be unique among all group level views and filters. \u2022 The name must not exist at the user or system level. \u2022 The name must not exist for a different group. System Views and Filters The following rules are applied when naming a system level view or filter: \u2022 The name must be unique among all system level views and filters. \u2022 The name must not exist at the user or group level.

Select the parts and appropriate part versions that you want to associate from the search results list. You can associate more than one version of a part to a product. Versioned parts can have more than one revision. For example, you can add part versions A.1 and B.1, but you could not add part A.1 and part A.2. The system automatically associates the latest iteration of the part, and updates to the latest iteration when an associated part version is updated. So when part A.1 is updated and becomes part A.2, the association is changed to A.2. 2. Click Add Existing Parts from the Action menu. 3. The selected parts are added to the product, and the following updates occur: \u25e6 The product version is iterated to identify that a part has been added to or removed from the product. \u25e6 The associated parts are displayed in a table on the Associated Parts tab of the product page. \u25e6 The parts table can be sorted by part name, part number, or version. Deleting a product in PTC FlexPLM also deletes the part association links. Copying and moving the PTC FlexPLM product does not impact the part associations. If a user attempts to delete an associated part in Windchill , the action does not complete until the association is removed. The attempt is logged in the Windchill Event Manager. Removing a Part from a Product If you determine that a part was incorrectly associated, or is no longer needed for a product, you can remove the part association. If the part you are trying to remove has been associated to one or more specifications, the Remove action does not complete. To remove the part association: 1. Navigate to the Parts tab for the product, and select the Associated Parts tab. 2. Select the checkbox next to the part or parts to remove from the Associated Parts table. To remove all parts, select the All checkbox in the table header. 3. Select Remove Selected Parts from the Action menu to remove the part association from the product.

            "title": "Part Structures",
            "information": "Part Structures Companies that produce consumer products need the ability to manage both the hard and soft components of their products.Engineering product structures are BOMs made of components, where each component is described by geometry that is provided in a CAD document, and other characteristics such as part number or source. Each component in an engineering BOM is a part and the part can be reused, substituted, and managed. Changes to a part can change its parent assembly and you might have configuration management rules that govern how part changes affect assembly and product changes. Merchandising BOMs are typically focused on data that correlates to the look and feel of a finished product, such as materials, colors, packaging, and labeling. Merchandising BOMs do not typically contain parts that are always defined by characteristics such as geometry. Parts in a merchandising BOM are similar to locations or reference designators such as sleeve, inner lining, and main body fabric.However, the important information in a merchandising BOM is the material list, which describes what each part is made of. Customers can more precisely describe a product to their suppliers and other internal users by specifying a BOM that is a combination of its engineering data and its merchandising data.This means you can communicate specific part numbers to suppliers. This communication reduces any confusion the supplier might have with which parts to use. For example, a designer developing the headrest of a stroller can communicate the latest design to a materials developer by associating the headrest part to the product. This allows the materials developer to select the appropriate fabric or make other important production decisions such as determining the needed fabric yardage. Was this helpful?

PTC FlexPLM manages the characterization of plans. When you create a new plan, you use attributes to define plan details such as name, description, and status. You also use attributes to define plan data such as bucket group, product count, and value attributes. Plans are displayed in a table layout with bucket group attributes in the rows and value attributes in the columns. The following is an example of a nonseasonal plan with detail attributes and data attributes. \u2022 Bucket group attributes make up rows in the plan. \u25e6 Examples of bucket attributes include Division , Gender Market , and Product Type . \u25e6 The order of bucket group attributes determines the hierarchy. For example, a hierarchy organized by Division , Gender Market , and Product Type might be set up as plans for Womens , Womens Casual , Tops , and Bottoms . \u2022 Value attributes make up the columns of the plan. \u25e6 Examples of value attributes include carryover percentage, knit/woven percentage, average retail target price, average cost, and margin percent. \u25e6 Examples of value attributes for product planning include size, colorway, product count, and target volume. \u25e6 You can enter plan data into the table for these attributes. \u25e6 When a plan is assigned to a season line plan, the system makes product placeholder associations. Placeholders can inherit attributes that you define in the plan. Potential products can be assigned to placeholders. \u25e6 PTC FlexPLM calculates product counts for a season plan. For example, if your plan for Womens Casual has a total product count of 100, then the sum of products for Tops and Bottoms must add up to 100. The system uses red values to display product counts that do not match the plan. \u2022 Plans can be seasonal and nonseasonal. You can create different types of plans for your business as needed.

Enter the following property setting: com.lcs.wc.client.web.CSVExcelGenerator.toggle= EXCEL Controlling the Image Location Path Use the following property setting to control the image location path. Administrators need to change the path when changing the urlContext from /Windchill to a different context. flexPLM.windchill.ImageLocation=/Windchill/netmarkets/imagesflexPLM.windchill.ClientImageLocation=/ Windchill /wt/clients/images Controlling the Thumbnail Size in the Header When you move your pointer over a thumbnail in the sticky headers for pages such as BOMs, materials, and products, a larger image appears. This property defines the size of the larger image. The default setting for this property is 300. This means the larger image is 300 x 300. jsp.image.StickyProductHeader.imageWidth= 300 If the original size of the image is smaller than 300x300, then the large thumbnail appears in the original size. If the width or height of the image is smaller or larger than 300, the larger thumbnail appears proportionately. Controlling Thumbnail Image Folders and Sub-Folders Thumbnail image files are stored in sub-folders when the maximum number of files have been stored in a folder. Administrators can control the number of files and folders with the following property settings. Use the following property to determine the maximum number of files in each folder and sub-folder. The number must be between 10,000 and 200,000. com.lcs.wc.content.imagefilePath.maxNumberOfFilesPerFolder= <number> Use the following property to determine the maximum number of folders in each folder and sub-folder. The number must be between 1,000 and 10,000. ccom.lcs.wc.content.imagefilePath.maxNumberOfFolders= <number> Use the following property to determine the maximum number of folder levels in the folder structure. The number must be between 1 and 5. com.lcs.wc.content.imagefilePath.numOfFolderLevels= <number> There is only one active folder in the system where thumbnail files are saved. By default, files are saved to the folder with highest number. When that folder reaches the maximum, the system creates a folder with a new number. For example, when the 0001 folder is full, the system creates a folder called 0002. If you delete a business object, the thumbnail is deleted from the file system. If you copy a business object, the thumbnail is duplicated and assigned to the copy. Even if the number of files in an inactive folder falls below the set limits due to object deletions, that folder does not become the active folder where files are saved. Files that were created in the images folder in previous releases are not relocated to a different folder. The following business objects support thumbnails: \u2022 Product \u2022 Placeholder \u2022 Colorway \u2022 Material \u2022 Material Color \u2022 Sample \u2022 Document Collection \u25e6 Inspiration \u25e6 Silhouette \u2022 Retail Document \u25e6 Image Page \u25e6 Other document types that can be associated as Reference Documents or Described By documents \u2022 Color \u2022 Measurements \u2022 Measurements POM \u2022 Last Controlling the Thumbnail Image File Size Use the following property setting to specify the maximum upload size of a thumbnail image on the Product, Placeholder, Colorway, Material and Color objects during drag and drop com.lcs.wc.content.thumbnailMaxFileSize=<number> . The default value for this property is 256000 Bytes. Use the following property to configure the maximum number of image files drop for default type Image Page creation com.lcs.wc.document.imagepages.dragnndrop.maxFileCount=8 . The default value for this property is 8. Use the following property to configure the image page type hierarchy com.lcs.wc.document.imagePages.dragnndrop.type=Document\\\\Images Page .

            "information": "Auto Create a New Sample or Sample Request Based on Status The sample approval process is mostly iterative. Samples get rejected, new samples get created and reviewed. This process continues till an approval is achieved for a particular intent and then repeated again when something changes. To make the process of requesting new samples efficient, FlexPLM is introducing the ability to auto-create a new sample when an existing one is rejected for any reason. The following sections describe configurations that an administrator needs to setup to enable this capability, These settings are configurable for all sample types at both the request and sample levels. Approval or rejection of a sample is entirely based on the value of a Sample Status attribute, and the approval or rejection of a sample request is entirely based on the value of a Sample Request Status attribute. You can configure all sample types and soft types at either the request level, or sample level, or at both the levels. Following are the scenarios for auto creation of sample or sample request based on its status: \u2022 If a user rejects a sample, then a new sample is auto created. For example, if \u2018sample-1\u2019 is rejected for a request a new Sample \u2018sample-2\u2019 is created for the same request. \u2022 If a user rejects a Sample Request then a new Sample Request with one sample gets auto created. For example, if Request1 is rejected then a new request \u2018Request1 (2)\u2019 is created with a new sample \u2018sample-1\u2019. \u2022 If a user rejects both the sample request and sample at the same time the sample request takes precedence and a new Request is automatically created with one sample in it. For example, if \u2018Request1\u2019 is rejected and \u2018sample-1\u2019 in \u2018Request1\u2019 is also rejected at the same time then a new Request is created with new Sample in it. That is, \u2018Request1 (2)\u2019 with\u2019 sample-1\u2019 will be created and \u2018Request1\u2019 will not have any new sample created for it Was this helpful?

            "information": "Constraining Product Types to Size Definition Types You can use the Type and Attribute Management utility to constrain product types to a specific size definition type and its subtypes. Constraining product types to size definition types allows you to more efficiently search the size definition template library when creating a product size definition by only listing relevant size definition templates. Out-of-the-box, all product types are constrained to the size definition root type. By default, you can access all size definition types when creating product size definitions. For example, if you create a product size definition for footwear, it is more efficient to list only those size definition templates on the Footwear type (or one of its subtypes). Similarly, when creating a product size definition for women\u2019s apparel, you might want to access only women\u2019s apparel size definition templates. Configuring Product and Size Definition Type Constraints To constrain a product type to a specific size definition type, do the following: 1. Select Administrative > Type and Attribute Management . 2. Select Part > Retail Part > Product . 3. From the Product type, select the name of the product type you want to constrain. 4. From the Actions menu, select Edit 5. From the Size Definition Type list, select the size definition type you want to constrain the product type to. If the list contains more than 20 items, click the find icon to open a window with a list of values to select from. 6. Click Save . This constrains the product type to the selected size definition type and any of that type\u2019s children (subtypes). For example, if you constrain the Women product type to the Women size definition type, the Women/Apparel size definition type is also accessible when creating product size definitions for products on the Women type. Constraint Inheritance Size definition constraints are inherited by product types. If you constrain the Women product type to the Women size definition type, then the Women/Apparel product type automatically inherits the size definition constraint to the Women size definition type. If you want a child product type to be constrained to a different size definition type than its parent, then you must manually configure the desired product and size definition constraint using the Type and Attribute Management utility.

Both size definition templates and product size definitions are typed using the same size definition type hierarchy. Size categories and full size ranges do not respect typing; both exist at the size definition root type. Size definition typing enables better management and reuse of size definition templates when creating product size definitions. Because size definitions can vary by product category, gender, brand, and market, you might want to use size definition types to organize and classify size definition templates and product size definitions. Size Definition Types and Attributes You can create size definition attributes to allow users to enter additional information about and further define both size definition templates and product size definitions. \u2022 Size definition attributes can be created on one of two types: \u25e6 The Size Definition type, which is used for attributes that define the size definition in general. \u25e6 The Size Definition to Season type, which is used for attributes that define the size definition as it applies to a particular season. \u2022 You can create additional subtypes using the Type and Attribute Management utility. \u2022 Out-of-the-box, there is one attribute group, the General Attributes group.

From the Type and Attribute Management utility, navigate to the subtype you want to configure, and select the Include In Tech Pack Generation attribute. For more information, see Setting Attribute Properties and Attribute Information Page . This attribute is inherited by all document subtypes. You must override the formula property to configure this functionality for document subtypes. On the attribute information page for the Include In Tech Pack Generation attribute, enter a value for the Formula field. \u2022 Enter 0.0 if you do not want the document type and any of its instances to be available for selection when generating tech packs. Documents of this type do not appear in the Available Reference Documents section. \u2022 Enter 1.0 if you want the document type and any of its instances to be available for selection when generating tech packs. If the document instances of this type meet all other criteria for valid documents, they appear in the Available Reference Documents section. By default, the system sets this value to 0.0 for all document types; therefore, no document types or their instances are available for selection when generating tech packs. Attribute Identification Details and Values The table below describes the attribute used to configure document inclusion in tech packs. This attribute is available out-of-the-box. Attribute Detail Description Internal Name includeInTechPackGeneration Display Name The out-of-the-box label is Include In Tech Pack Generation . The name of this attribute appears differently if the label has been modified. Type Calculated Data Type Real Number FlexPLM Attribute Type Constant Default value 0.0 Possible values 0.0 or 1.0 Attribute Inheritance The Include In Tech Pack Generation attribute exists on the document root type, and is inherited by all document subtypes and their children. If you want a child document type to have a different document inclusion designation than its parent type, then you must update the attribute value for the child document type. To change the attribute value for a child document type, you must override the formula property for the Include In Tech Pack Generation attribute on the given type. After you have created the property override, you can update the attribute value for the given child type. If the child document type has children of its own, those children inherit the overridden attribute and its value. Including Documents in Pre-Configured Specification Requests You can use the following property setting to automatically select document types as part of a pre-configured specification request. jsp.specification.ChooseSingleSpecPage2.availDocs. SpecificationRequestName = DocumentTypes To configure the property setting to work with your pre-configured specification requests, replace the above variables as follows: \u2022 Replace SpecificationRequestName with the name of the pre-configured specification request. The two out-of-the-box specification requests are Development and Product ; however, you might have configured additional specification requests. \u2022 Replace DocumentTypes with the document types you want to include. If you want to include multiple document types, enter them as a comma separated list. Document subtypes are entered as property setting values as Document\\\\Subtype , where Subtype is the name of the subtype. Including Secondary Content in Pre-Configured Specification Requests You can use the following property setting to automatically select secondary content as part of a pre-configured specification request. jsp.specification.ChooseSingleSpecPage2.includeSecondaryContent. SpecificationRequestName = true To configure the property setting to work with your pre-configured specification requests, replace the variables as follows: \u2022 Replace SpecificationRequestName with the name of the pre-configured specification request. The two out-of-the-box specification requests are Development and Product ; however, you might have configured additional specification requests. \u2022 Set the value of the property setting to true or false . Setting the value to true automatically includes secondary content when the pre-configured specification is selected. Setting the value to false excludes secondary content. Specifying the Default Document Type for Vaulted Tech Packs You can use the following property setting to automatically select a specific document type for vaulted tech packs. The system automatically selects the specified document type and inserts it as the value for the Vault Document Type field when generating tech packs. com.lcs.wc.document.documentVault.document.flexType= Document\\\\Generated Tech Pack The out-of-the-box value for this property setting is Document\\\\Generated Tech Pack . By default, the system automatically selects the GeneratedTechPack document type for vaulted tech packs. You can update this property setting to automatically select a different type. Users can change the document type to a subtype of the type specified by the above property setting. When generating tech packs, users can click the Vault Document Type field, and select a subtype of the given type as the document type for the vaulted tech pack. Automatic Asynchronous Tech Pack Generation You can use the following property settings to automatically generate tech packs asynchronously; these property settings control whether or not the system automatically selects the Generate Tech Pack in Background checkbox when generating tech packs. This functionality is disabled by default. Out-of-the-box, the value for both property settings is false , and users must manually select asynchronous tech pack generation. To specify automatic asynchronous tech pack generation when generating single tech packs, change the following property setting to true : com.lcs.wc.specification.SingleTPGenAsynService.defaultSelected= true To specify automatic asynchronous tech pack generation when generating multiple tech packs, change the following property setting to true : com.lcs.wc.product.MultiTPGenAsyncService.defaultSelected= true In addition, the following property settings are used to indicate which classes and methods are used to execute asynchronous tech pack generation. These property settings are provided for informational purposes.

            "information": "Including Documents and Parts in Multiple Tech Packs 40269 You can include related documents and parts when exporting multiple tech packs from the line sheet by selecting them during the tech pack generation process. Parts must be associated to the product specification before they are available for inclusion in a tech pack. Out-of-the-box, image pages are not considered documents for the purpose of tech pack generation; they do not appear as available documents, but as available specification components. However, your administrator can configure your system to include image pages as available documents. Selecting Documents to Export In the Select Pages window, the system displays the Available Reference Documents list box in the Specification Components Available section if there are valid document types available for export. Use the list box to select those document types to include with the exported tech pack. If the Available Reference Documents list box is not displayed, then there are no valid documents available. When you select a specific document type for export, the system includes all valid document instances of the specified types for inclusion. It also includes all valid document instances of the specified types\u2019 children types for inclusion. For example, given the following type hierarchy: \u2022 Document \u25e6 Document/Apparel \u25aa Document/Apparel/Patterns \u25aa Document/Apparel/RFQ \u25e6 Document/Footwear If you select the Document/Apparel type for inclusion, then the system automatically includes all of the valid Document/Apparel/Patterns and Document/Apparel/RFQ type instances, in addition to all of the Document/Apparel type instances. Selecting the Document type selects all document instances, including all document subtype instances. Despite the fact that the system includes all of the selected type\u2019s children types, it does not automatically add these document type names to the Chosen box on the right. Including Secondary Content By default, the system exports primary content only. If you want to include secondary content, such as a web viewable file, select the Include Secondary Content for All Documents checkbox. The system includes all secondary content for all selected documents in the ZIP file that is generated. Including Linked Product and Child Specification Documents Linked products and child specifications might have associated documents that you want to include in the exported tech pack. Selecting the Include Child Specifications and Documents checkbox in the Specification Components Available section displays the names of the valid documents that are associated to the linked products and child specifications in the Available Reference Documents section. Pre-Configured Specification Requests Pre-configured specification requests, which you can select from the Spec Request list in the Specification Components Available section, can be configured to automatically select documents for inclusion in the tech pack. Documents are included in pre-configured specification requests based on document type. The system selects all valid document instances of the specified types for inclusion. It also includes all valid document instances of the specified types\u2019 children types for inclusion. Including Part Information Part visibility must be enabled as described in Working with Part Structures . To include part information in a multi-tech pack, you need to select the Part Data report and the Include All Parts checkbox in the Specifications page. If you want part structures to be exported in the Part Data report, those structures can be included by selecting the Show Indented BOM checkbox.

Out-of-the-box, PTC FlexPLM includes three BOM reports, two measurements reports, and two tracked changes reports. Each BOM report is generated for each BOM selected, and each measurements report is generated for the measurements set selected. BOM: Colorway \u2013 Material Color The BOM: Colorway \u2013 Material Color report generates a PDF of each of the requested BOMs, representing the previously selected colorways. The columns displayed in each section of the table are defined by the view you select for that BOM section. For each BOM section, the report lists all materials and the material color used for each colorway. The table includes a primary row for each material used. Colors are indicated by name where appropriate, and a shaded cell with an X indicates that a material is not used for that colorway. This report displays subassembly (complex material) information. Components that are part of a complex material are displayed on separate, indented rows below the main component. Colors are indicated where appropriate by name, and a shaded cell with an X indicates that a material is not used for that colorway. You can control the number of colorways that are displayed in the table by entering a numerical value for the Number of Colorways per page field in the Page Options section. Entering a value of 2, for example, alters the report\u2019s appearance, reducing the number of colorways in each section. The additional colorways are displayed in a table in a repeated BOM section. You can also select the Show Color Swatches and Show Material Thumbnails checkboxes. BOM: Single BOM The BOM: Single BOM report generates a single PDF with a separate table for each dimension combination (colorway-size-destination) selected. This report is most useful when you want to export a specific subset of dimensions. Based upon the number of colorways, sizes, and destinations selected, the system might generate a PDF with a large number of pages. This report might take longer to generate than the other out of the box reports, and can slow down system performance while running. The columns displayed in each section of the table are defined by the view you select for that BOM section. BOM: Sizing \u2013 Quantity The BOM: Sizing \u2013 Quantity report generates a PDF of each of the requested BOMs representing the previously selected Sizes. The columns displayed in each section of the table are defined by the view you select for that BOM section. For each BOM section, the report lists all materials and the quantity for each size using that material. The table includes a primary row for each material used, and indicates the quantity of that material needed for each size. Material overrides are again indented under the primary material row in this report, and a shaded cell with an X indicates that the material is not used for a specific size. This report only contains quantity values for sizes in the BOM if the size override values match the selected sizes. This report displays subassembly (complex material) information. Components that are part of a complex material are displayed on separate, indented rows below the main component. Sizes are indicated where appropriate by quantity, and a shaded cell with an X indicates that a material is not used for that size. You can control the number of sizes that are displayed in the table by entering a numerical value for the Number of Sizes per page field in the Page Options section. Entering a value of 3, for example, alters the report\u2019s appearance, reducing the number of sizes per section. The additional sizes are displayed in a table in a repeated BOM section. You can also choose to show material thumbnails by selecting the Show Material Thumbnails checkbox in the Page Options section. Measurement Set: FitSpec The Measurement Set: FitSpec report displays three sample values: Requested , Actual , and New . \u2022 The Requested value is the requested value of the last sample. \u2022 The Actual value is the actual value of the last sample. \u2022 The New value is the new value requested of the current sample. The report also displays the sample number, measurement name, tolerances, and comments. Actual values that are greater than the requested values are displayed in red. Measurement Set: Grades The Measurement Set: Grades report generates a PDF of the selected measurements sets on that particular specification. You must select the relevant sizes for the measurement set to appear in the report, or you receive an error. To control the number of sizes that are displayed in the table, enter a numerical value for the Number of Sizes per page field in the Page Options section. Entering a value of 3, for example, alters the report\u2019s appearance, reducing the number of sizes per page. The additional sizes are on subsequent pages, and include the shaded base size for reference. Tracked Changes: Expanded The Tracked Changes: Expanded report provides details about the components selected for change tracking. Each component table indicates the user identity, date and time of the last check-in, changed item attribute and details about the prior value to the current value. Use the expanded version of the report if you need to share greater detail for tracked changes. Tracked Changes: Condensed The Tracked Changes: Condensed report shows a summary of tracked changes, showing the component changed, the initial value, and the current value.

This allows you and other users to easily reference previously generated tech packs without requiring you to manually upload content. During the tech pack generation process, select the Document Vault checkbox in the Document Vault section to save the resulting ZIP file as the primary content of an associated specification document. Selecting this checkbox displays the Vault Document Type field. Clicking this field displays a portion of the document type hierarchy, and allows you to select the document type for the resulting ZIP file, provided that you have view and create permissions for the given type. Out-of-the-box, the system defaults to the GeneratedTechPack document type and any of its subtypes, if they exist. Your administrator might have specified a different default document type for vaulted tech packs. Once the system has generated the tech pack, the ZIP file appears as an associated document for the specification for which it was generated. The system automatically names the file \u201cTech Pack for Specification Name / Product Name \u2014 Number ,\u201d where Number is the ordinal number of the tech pack. If you generate another tech pack for the same specification, the system saves the output as a new document instance; it does not save subsequent tech packs as iterations of existing tech pack documents.

PTC FlexPLM is implementing new capabilities to support the review of 3D materials.As a first step, PTC FlexPLM introduced an ability to upload a 3D material file using the .u3ma format. The system auto-generates a web-viewable version of that content and displays it in a 3D Viewer. The primary objective of this new feature is to enhance the 3D material review process. The enhanced process supports visual reviews of fabrics scanned into the .u3ma file format either manually using Vizoo or Fab scanners, or alternately using the Textura for AI-generated digital textiles. Additional capabilities include the ability to associate the uploaded 3D material scans with multiple materials and experience the 3D rendering of the materials. \u2022 You can copy the materials. 3D material scans can also be directly created from within the document library. In this case, the material association does not happen automatically, and you must do it manually. If a material is deleted, its associated 3D material is not deleted. \u2022 If a 3D material scan is deleted, its related 3D material view is also deleted. If a 3D material scan is updated, then its corresponding 3D material is also updated. Two new document sub-types are now available: \u2022 3D material scan\u2014Primarily a content holder of the raw 3D material scan. Supported formats are U3MA and ZFAB. \u2022 3D material view that is a sub-type of visual assets\u2014Intended as the viewer for a viewable version of the uploaded 3D material scan content. The PTC FlexPLM supports only viewable versions of U3MA content.

            "information": "Logical Attributes Report The Logical Attributes Report is a report on the attributes and their external forms for a given type. The Logical Attributes Report is available from Customization > Tools . This menu is not enabled by default. For instructions to enable the preference for this menu, see the \u201cCustomization Tools Overview\u201d topic in the Windchill Help Center . The Logical Attribute Report for a type lists mappings that have already been used for that type in addition to those used for alias attributes in the Type and Attribute Management utility. The creation of logical attributes is a feature of the LogicalIdentifierFactory . When you pass the LogicalIdentifierFactory a logical form in the context of a TypeIdentifier , for example, factory.get(\"name\", \"wt.part.WTPart\") , it tries to treat the logical form as an attribute of the type. It goes through several steps to try and find a mapping for the logical form: 1. First it looks for the logical form in logicalIdentifier.properties . So if \"name\" is defined in logicalIdentifier.properties to map to \" MBA|foobar \", then \" MBA|foobar \" will get returned. 2. If there wasn't an entry in logicalIdentifier.properties , it looks in the /codebase/LogicalAttributes.xml file. This file has the following format: .... <Class name=\"wt.enterprise.RevisionControlled\"> <Property> <LogicalForm>name</LogicalForm> <ExternalForm>MBA|name</ExternalForm> </Property> </Class> .... The factory looks in this xml file to see if the requested logical form has an entry specified for the type that was passed in by the user. If there isn't an entry for the requested type, it sees if there is an entry for any of the type's supertypes. Multiple inheritance conflicts are resolved by two rules: a. Parent classes win over parent interfaces b. Parent interfaces win by alphabetical order (so \" java.util.Map \" wins over \" java.util.Set \"). (more configurable solution is possible). 3. If there wasn't a matching entry in LogicalAttributes.xml , then the factory does introspection to try and find a match. This works by getting a list of all AttributeTypeIdentifiers defined for the requested type, and seeing if the logical form matches any of the attribute names in the list. Report Output The report output has four columns. The first two columns map an attribute's logical form to the external form that the factor will return. The third column shows where the factory got the external form -- either from logicalIdentifier.properties , LogicalAttributes.xml , or Introspection. The fourth column shows the business field identifier. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

If multiple constraints are added to an attribute, then the attribute values must satisfy all of the enabled constraints on that attribute. Rule Data Types Description Example Data Enumerated Value List String Composite Multi Entry An enumerated list of legal values. This enumerated list can: \u2022 Use a global enumeration \u2022 Be based on a global enumeration \u2022 Be uniquely created for this condition If an Enumerated Value List condition uses or is based on a global enumeration, the name of the selected global enumeration displays when creating or editing the constraint. If there are multiple Enumerated Value List constraints, the common values of the constraints are used to build the legal value list. If there are no common values, the legal value list does not contain values. You can add Enumerated Value List constraints to multi entry data types that have a FlexPLM Attribute Type of Multi List . If you add Enumerated Value List constraints to multi entry data types that have FlexPLM Attribute Type of Multi Entry , the system ignores the list. For details on adding data to an enumerated value list, see Enumerated Value List Constraints . For multiple constraints, if the first list contains Blue , Green , and Red , and the second list contains Blue , Yellow , and Red , the list contains the common values Blue and Red . Valid Range Real Number Date and Time Integer The actual value of the attribute must be equal to or between the values specified (the range is inclusive). The From field specifies the minimum value; the To field specifies the maximum value. If there are multiple constraints, the valid range contains the common values. If there are no common values among the multiple constraints, then there are no valid values for the attribute. For the numerical data types, if the valid range is specified as From 1 To 7 , allowable attribute values include 2 and 7 , but not 9 . For multiple integer constraints, if the first constraint has a range from 1 to 6, and the second constraint has a range from 3 to 7, the valid range is from 3 to 6. For multiple float constraints, if the first constraint has a range from 2.5 to 10.4, the second constraint has a range from 3.5 to 15.6, and the third constraint has a range from 4.2 to 20.6, the valid range is from 4.2 to 10.4. For multiple string constraints, if the first constraint has a length from 3 to 20 and the second constraint has a range from 10 to 50, the valid range is from 10 to 20. String Length String The length of the string value must be greater than or equal to the minimum, and less than or equal to the maximum values specified (the range is inclusive). The From field specifies the minimum value; the To field specifies the maximum value. If the string length is specified as From 3 To 200 , then the number of characters in the string can be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 200. Required All except Image and Sequence The attribute must have at least one value. If there are multiple constraints, the value contains the most restrictive rule. No data is specified for this constraint. For multiple constraints, if you have a required enabled and a required disabled constraint, the value is required because of the enabled constraint. Single-Valued All data types for local attributes. No more than one value is allowed. PTC FlexPLM does not support multi-valued attributes. All attributes in PTC FlexPLM are considered to have this constraint applied. No data is specified for this constraint. Legal Type List Object Reference Version Reference The list of allowable types for the reference link. Only the type and subtypes of the type specified for the Other Side Class attribute can be specified. You must specify the Internal Name of the type, rather than the Display Name . PTC FlexPLM types must include the caret ( ^ ) in front of the type name. If there are multiple constraints, and the constraints are on types in the same branch of the type hierarchy, the value contains the most restrictive rule. If there are multiple constraints, and the constraints are on types in different branches of the type hierarchy, the Legal Type List constraint cannot be created. If the legal type list is specified as ^com.lcs.wc.document.LCSDocument , then only documents of the Document parent type and all of its subtypes can be selected for this attribute. For multiple constraints, if the first constraint is specified as ^com.lcs.wc.color.LCSColor and the second constraint is ^com.ptc.SolidColors , the valid Legal Type List is ^com.ptc.SolidColors . External Enumerated Value List String Multi Entry Composite An enumerated list of legal values from an external source. The following list-based attributes are supported: \u2022 Single List \u2022 Multi List \u2022 Color Choice \u2022 Composite This enumerated list can: \u2022 Support localized values \u2022 Support a sort order \u2022 Be dynamically updated from the external source Conditions cannot be added on external enumerated value list constraints. Although the External Enumerated Value List option appears in the Constraints tab, Driven attributes are not supported. Once the external enumerated value list constraint has been added to an attribute, specify the class name of the EnumerationInfoProvider implementation and the initialization string customized for this value list. In the first field, enter the fully qualified name of the custom class that is your custom EnumerationInfoProvider . In the second field, enter the initialization string required by the custom class file. For details on creating and adding data to the external enumerated value list, see \u201cExternal Enumerated Value Lists\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . Immutable All Attribute values cannot be set, edited, or removed. \u2022 This constraint has been exposed in the FlexPLM Type and Attribute Management user interface to satisfy the pre-requisites for running the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility. The constraint is NOT functional in the core FlexPLM user interface or FlexPLM server. Hence, it must not be used by Site Administrators. \u2022 Calculated attributes always have an Immutable constraint, as their values are derived from their formulas, rather than edited.

When finished, click OK to create the new attribute. You are returned to the Manage Types window, with the information page for the attribute displaying in the right pane. (Click Apply to create the new attribute, but remain in the New Attribute window to create additional attributes.) Define Attributes 1. Specify an Internal Name for the attribute. The value specified for the internal name is case-sensitive, and must be unique on all subtypes and parent types of this type. This is a required field. 2. Select the attribute Type . Not every type of attribute can be created on every type. Only those attribute types that can be created on the type are displayed. \u25e6 Local \u2014Local attributes can have only zero or one value for an attribute. Local attributes are stored in columns directly on the underlying object class. If there are no additional columns available on the class for new local attributes, an error message displays when you attempt to complete the creation of a new local attribute. Out-of-the-box, there are no additional columns on any object class for local attributes. For information on adding columns for local attributes, see Adding Columns to Types . \u25e6 Alias \u2014 Alias attributes are used for adding reusable tables to a type. Once alias attributes for reusable tables are added to a type, they need to be added to an attribute layout. For more information, see Adding a Reusable Table to an Attribute Layout . \u25e6 Calculated \u2014Calculated attributes are used to represent attributes that have a constant value. Calculated attributes are non-persisted attributes, meaning that once a value has been set for the constant attribute in the Type and Attribute Management utility, the value is valid for all object instances of the type on which the calculated attribute is defined. Setting the constant attribute value is achieved by placing the value in the Formula property of a calculated attribute. For information on the differences between calculated, derived string, and derived numeric attributes, see Derived String, Derived Numeric, and Calculated Attribute Comparison . Choose Data Type For local, alias, and calculated attribute types, select the data type from the Data Type list. The data type of an attribute cannot be changed after the attribute has been created.

            "title": "Formulas",
            "information": "Formulas Local attributes in PTC FlexPLM that represent either derived string or derived numeric attributes use formulas to derive their values from the values of other attributes. Formulas for derived string and derived numeric attributes can use both attribute and literal values to compute or generate a derived attribute value. Calculated attributes in PTC FlexPLM can only contain a literal numeric constant value. You can define the expression to evaluate in the Formula field during the Set Properties step of creating the calculated, derived string, or derived numeric attribute, or by editing the Formula field on the attribute information page once the calculated, derived string, or derived numeric attribute has been created. If an attribute affecting a derived numeric or derived string attribute is modified when creating or editing an object, the formula is not immediately reevaluated. Once the create action or edit action is processed, the formula is reevaluated and the attribute value is updated. Data Types in Formulas Only attributes of the following data types are supported in formulas: Derived String , String , Integer Number , Real Number , Boolean , Date and Time , Object Reference , Version Reference , and Hyperlink . The result of the formula must match the specified data type of the derived string or derived numeric attribute, but attributes of different data types can be used within the formula itself. When attributes of different data types are used within the formula, the system converts the data types to the same data type as required for the operation or function used in the formula, before performing the operation or function. The formula result is in that same data type. The data type conversion is applied in the following priority order: 1. String \u2014if at least one argument in the formula has a data type of String , all arguments are converted to have a data type of String . ( Hyperlink , Date and Time , and Derived String are automatically converted to String .) 2. Real Number \u2014if at least one argument in the formula has a data type of Real Number , all arguments are converted to have a data type of Real Number . 3. Integer Number \u2014if at least one argument in the formula has a data type of Integer Number , all arguments are converted to have a data type of Integer Number . 4. Boolean . For example, in the formula attrA + attrB , if attrA is a String data type and attrB is a Real Number data type, attrB is converted to a String data type and concatenated with attrA . If the value of attrA is Result: and the value of attrB is 1.5 , then the result of the formula is Result:1.5 . Similarly, if attrC is an Integer Number data type, and attrD is a Real Number data type, then in the formula attrC * attrD , attrC is converted to a Real Number data type, and the result of the formula is a Real Number data type. The system validates expressions entered in the Formula field to ensure that the data type result matches the data type of the derived string or derived numeric attribute. If the data type of the evaluated result does not match the data type of the derived string or derived numeric attribute, the formula is not saved. The data type of a formula result can be converted by changing how the formula is specified. In the following, <formula> is the original formula whose data type is being converted. \u2022 To convert a formula resulting in a Boolean , Integer Number , or Real Number to a String data type, enter the following in the Formula field: \"\"+( <formula> ) \u2022 To convert a formula resulting in a Boolean or Integer Number data type to a Real Number data type, enter the following in the Formula field: 1.0*( <formula> ) \u2022 To convert a formula resulting in a Boolean data type to an Integer Number data type, enter the following in the Formula field: 1*( <formula>) The system substitutes the respective values of all attributes found in expressions, if a string based attribute is used in the condition of the ternary operator within the formula of a numeric attribute, and that string attribute has no default value the value substitution will result in a NULL value, and an exception will be thrown when attempting to evaluate the expression because the condition must evaluate to a boolean or an integer value for the ternary operator to evaluate as expected. To avoid NULL values in the condition, convert the potentially NULL string attribute to an empty string value by changing how the formula is specified. \u2022 To ensure the attribute testCostSheetType in this example evaluates to a string data type, and the condition evaluates to a boolean result, concatenate the empty string to the potentially NULL attribute value (\u201c\u201d+testCostSheetType==\"testAA\")?2.11:1.22 Example: Calculating a Numerical Value Use operators and internal names of attributes to build formulas which calculate the desired attribute value. (You must use the Internal Name of an attribute in formulas, rather than its Display Name .) For example, if you had a Total Cost attribute, which is meant to be the value of the Quantity attribute multiplied by the value of the Unit Cost attribute, plus the value of the Handling Fee attribute, you could use the following formula to calculate the Total Cost attribute value: (quantity*unitCost)+fee Example: Combining Non-Numerical Attribute Values Formulas can also be used to combine non-numerical attribute values. For example, if you created a derived string attribute named ID, you could combine the values of the Name and Number attributes of the type as the value of the ID attribute using the following formula: name+\"(\"+number+\")\" This would result in an ID attribute value such as MyDocument(0001A) . Example: Including White Space Between Values To include white space between values for derived string attributes, include the space between quotes in your formula, as follows: brand+\" \"+year This would result in a value such as Brandname 2014 . Supported Functions There are no multi-valued functions currently supported for calculated attributes. The following functions are supported: Function Description isNull( ) Null check str( ) Convert number to String data type abs( ) Absolute value or magnitude avg( ) Average of a list of values sum( ) Sum of a list of values min( ) Minimum of a list of values max( ) Maximum of a list of values round() Converts a number with a decimal (real number) into an integer number \u2022 When the decimal contains .5, the number is rounded to an even number (for example, 30.5 is rounded down to 30 and 31.5 is rounded up to 32) \u2022 When the decimal contains other numbers, the number is rounded to the nearest number (for example, 30.8 is rounded up to 31 and 33.4 is rounded down to 33) mod() Returns the remainder of one number divided by another number. ( Integer data types, only) ${} Wraps attribute internal names which include special characters, so they can be used within the formula. All attribute internal names can be wrapped, but attribute internal names which include the dollar sign ($) or square brackets ([ ]) must be wrapped when used in formulas. For example, attributes with internal names of my$attribute or my[very$complex]attribute can be used in a formula when wrapped as follows: \u2022 ${my$attribute} \u2022 ${my[very$complex]attribute} If the attributes used in the \u201cExample: Calculating a Numerical Value\u201d section above had internal names which include special characters, the formula for the Total Cost attribute could appear as follows: (${item$quantity}*${unit$cost})+${handling$fee} Attributes in PTC FlexPLM cannot contain hyphens, underscores, or periods. Supported Operators The following operators are supported: Operator Description + Addition; can also be used to concatenate strings - Subtraction * Multiplication / Division ( ) Open and closed parentheses, to indicate a different priority in the order of operations (the operations within the parenthesis are to be performed first) \" \" Double quotes, to indicate that the content of the quotes is a literal string. Any non-number not inside double quotes is treated as an attribute name > Greater than < Less than >= Greater than or equal to <= Less than or equal to == Equal to != Not equal ^ Power or exponentiation & And | Or ~ Not ^* Exclusive or && And || Or ! Not ? : Conditional operator, indicating the result if the specified condition is true or false: ( condition ) ? value if true : value if false For example, assume that a type has attributes of length, width, and shape, where shape is a calculated attribute with the following formula: (length>width) ? \"longer\" : \"wider\" If the value of the length attribute is greater than the value of the width attribute, then the shape attribute is assigned a value of longer . If the value of the length attribute is not greater than the value of the width attribute, then the shape attribute is assigned a value of wider . % Remainder Related Topics Synchronized Attributes .

            "information": "Editing an Attribute Group Attribute groups are the most common layout element. Within an attribute group, individual attributes can be ordered and arranged as desired. An attribute group layout element is composed of three panes, from left to right: \u2022 The list of attributes available to be included in the attribute group. \u2022 The layout definition pane, where the display order of attributes in the user interface is defined. If the attribute group is inherited, the inheritance icon displays in the toolbar of the layout definition pane. \u2022 The layout element information for the group. The attribute group contents can be modified in numerous ways: Edit the layout element information for the attribute group. Edit the layout element information for the attribute group by adding or modifying the Group Display Name and Group Description . These fields are both optional. The Group Display Name , if specified, displays in the user interface for the screen types where the attribute layout is used. Ensure that the value entered for the Group Display Name provides a meaningful label for the group in the end-user user interface. If the attribute group is inherited, the inheritance icon displays next to the Group Display Name field. The Group Display Name and Group Description can be changed on inherited attribute groups on an inherited attribute layout. Edit the class name in the Background CSS Class field to add or change the class from an existing custom cascading style sheet stored as a CSS file in the codebase. This field enables administrators to specify a custom cascading style sheet class when rendering a layout element in the end-user user interface. A different class can be specified for each layout element in an attribute layout. If this field is left blank, the system uses the default style sheet in PTC FlexPLM for that layout element. Edit the value of the Background CSS Class field to specify a unique string value to be used as the class attribute value on the HTML div element that acts as the visual container for the attribute group on the rendered page in the user interface. By overriding the default value of the class attribute, the administrator is able to override the CSS style rule that is applied to the attribute group. To complete the override and apply a different style to the attribute group, the administrator must use CSS class selector notation to assign a custom style rule for any HTML element whose class is the value specified in the Background CSS Class field. The new rule should be defined in the main.css style sheet. For example, if you specify a value of yellowGroup for the Background CSS Class field, the HTML renders as: <div class=\"yellowGroup\"> [attribute group content here] </div> The rule to be defined in the main.css file is: .yellowGroup { background-color: #ffff9a; } The Background CSS Class value is always the value that is assigned to the named layout component on the highest level ancestor type in the type hierarchy. When an ancestor type has a value present, the system ignores values defined on subtypes for the same named attribute group. Make the attribute group the default group for the layout. If you want new attributes created on the type to be automatically added to this attribute group, select the Make default group checkbox in the layout element information pane. Having a default group designated on an attribute layout is optional. There can be only one default group designated on an attribute layout. The default group of an inherited attribute layout cannot be changed. \u2022 If a default group is designated in the parent of an inherited attribute layout, all new attributes created on the subtype are automatically added to that default group in the inherited attribute layout. \u2022 If no default group is specified in the parent attribute layout, a default group cannot be specified on the inherited attribute layout. Add attributes to, reorder attributes within, or remove attributes from the attribute group. Add attributes to the attribute group as needed. From the Available Attributes list, drag-and-drop individual attributes into the central attribute group display pane. When you hover over an available location with your mouse, an Add attribute to this group prompt appears. Once an attribute is used in an attribute group, it is no longer available for use in any other attribute group in the same attribute layout. Do not add more than one attribute with the same Display Name to the same attribute layout. Reorder the attributes within the attribute group. To arrange the attributes in the order you would like them to appear. drag-and-drop the attribute to the appropriate location in the table. When you hover over an available location with your mouse, a Reorder attribute prompt appears. To add more vertical spacing between attributes, you can allow blank rows between attributes in the attribute group, unless it is in an attribute layout on a Reusable Table subtype. The system does not allow the use of blank table cells in reusable tables. To remove an attribute from the attribute group, drag-and-drop the attribute back to the Available Attributes list. Attributes can be moved to a different attribute group in the same attribute layout using drag-and-drop. If the attribute layout is inherited from a parent type, only attributes created on the subtype are included in the Available Attributes list, and can be added or removed from the attribute group pane. Inherited attributes in an attribute group are identified with the inheritance icon . Inherited attributes cannot be removed from the group or moved to a new group, but can be reordered within the group using drag-and-drop if the display style for the attribute group is Organized in Grid . Set the display style for the attribute group. Select the desired display style for the group: \u2022 Organized in Grid \u2014Attributes can be organized in multiple columns, in any order. New columns can be added to inherited groups that have a display style of organized in grid. PTC FlexPLM types other than reusable types have a maximum of two layout columns. Reusable Table types have one layout column. The Organized in Grid display style is the only display style supported for attribute groups in attribute layouts for PTC FlexPLM types. The Alphabetical List style is visible, but it is not supported by PTC FlexPLM at this time. The display style cannot be changed on inherited attribute groups in an attribute layout, but can be changed on newly created attribute groups added to an inherited attribute layout. Arranging attributes in the Organized in Grid display style When using the Organized in Grid display style, you can further arrange the display of the attributes: \u2022 Attributes can be positioned in any open cell in the grid. Drag-and-drop an attribute from cell to cell until it is in the desired location. Blank cells can be left in the grid.

When an AGVR is created by the system, the group name associated to it is taken from the Master Text value of the Display Name property of the layout element or attribute group. AGVRs are not directly associated to a layout element because multiple layout elements can share the same name within a type hierarchy. For example, this can happen when an administrator breaks layout inheritance on a subtype, creates a new layout, and then creates a new layout element using the same name as a layout element on the parent type. Also, layout elements across synchronized types can have the same name. Updating Master Text Values in Layout Elements If a layout element is renamed within a branch and/or within a synchronized set, all other layout elements with the same original Master Text value are updated with the new Master Text value. Deleting Layout Elements You cannot delete layout elements from a parent type if the same Master Text value exists on a subtype. You must first delete the layout element from the subtype before deleting it from the parent type. Viewing Attribute Group Visibility Rules To view attribute group visibility rules, do the following: 1. From the side navigation bar, select Administrative > Type and Attribute Management . 2. Under Manage Types , select a type. 3. On the type information page, from the Actions menu, click Manage Attribute Group Visibility Rules . The defined rules appear in read-only mode in the Attribute Group Visibility Rules window. \u25e6 This window contains a table of all existing AGVRs for all logical attribute groups that represent the layout elements for the selected type. \u25e6 If the selected type is a subtype, and layout inheritance has not been broken for the subtype, the table lists AGVRs for all of the logical groups that represent the layout elements for the type that are inherited from parent types and are local to the subtype. \u25e6 If the selected type is a subtype, and layout inheritance has been broken, the table lists AGVRs for all of the logical groups that represent the layout elements for that subtype. \u25e6 For any synchronized type set, the table lists all AGVRs that apply for the given type across the synchronized type set. If there are groups or layout elements that exist on another member of the type set at the same level, but do not exist on the given type being edited, they still appear in the table. The table contains the following columns: Item Description Group Name The name of the layout components that the AGVR is created against. Viewable By The list of user groups that have been granted view permissions to the layout component. Creatable By The list of user groups that have been granted create permissions to the layout component. Editable By The list of user groups that have been granted edit permissions to the layout component. If the permission has been granted to all users, then All appears in the Viewable By , Creatable By , or Editable By fields. 4. Click the close icon to close the window. Setting Attribute Group Visibility Rules To set attribute group visibility rules, do the following: You must be in edit mode to update attribute group visibility rules. All changes you make in the Update Attribute Group Visibility Rules windows are saved when you click Finish . 1. From the side navigation bar, select Administrative > Type and Attribute Management . 2. Under Manage Types , select a type. 3. On the type information page, from the Actions menu, click Manage Attribute Group Visibility Rules . The defined rules appear in read-only mode in the Attribute Group Visibility Rules window. 4. Under the Group Name column, click the name of the group to update. 5. In the Update Attribute Group Visibility Rules window, update the rules for the group. \u25e6 To apply rules to all users, select the Viewable By All , Creatable By All , or Editable By All checkboxes. \u25e6 To apply rules to specific groups, clear the Viewable By All , Creatable By All , or Editable By All checkbox. \u25e6 Under Options for Viewable Groups , Creatable Groups , or Editable Groups , select the group and click Add .

If the inherited attribute group is designated as the default group for the attribute layout, new attributes created on the subtype are automatically added to this inherited attribute group. \u2022 New columns can be added to the inherited attribute group, when the inherited display style for the attribute group is Organized in Grid . PTC FlexPLM types other than Reusable Table types have a maximum of two layout columns. Reusable Table types have one layout column. \u2022 The positions of inherited attributes can be reordered or moved within the same inherited attribute group using drag-and-drop. \u2022 Empty cells (called separators) can be left within the grid display. Attribute Position Inheritance Inherited attribute groups which have the Organized in Grid inherited display style initially inherit the row and column grid positions of all attributes from the parent attribute group on the parent type. This is referred to as attribute position inheritance. As long as the inherited attribute layout is not edited and saved, when an attribute in the parent attribute group is moved to a different position, that attribute in the inherited attribute group also moves to the new position. Editing and saving an inherited attribute layout severs the attribute position inheritance from the parent attribute group. When an inherited attribute layout is edited in any way and then saved, the current position of all the attributes in that inherited attribute group is saved, severing the attribute position inheritance for all of the inherited attributes. (Inherited attribute layouts that have not been edited retain their attribute position inheritance.) Once attribute position inheritance is severed, if an attribute in the parent attribute group is moved to a different position, that attribute in the inherited group does not move to the new position. Attribute Position Conflicts and Resolution When attribute position inheritance is broken in inherited attribute groups, there is the potential for subsequent changes to the parent attribute group on the parent type to result in conflicts with the position of attributes or separators in the inherited attribute group on the subtype. The type management system identifies and resolves these conflicts by processing the position of each attribute and separator in the parent attribute layout against the position of each attribute and separator in the inherited attribute layout. If the position of an attribute or separator in an inherited attribute layout conflicts with the position of an attribute or separator in the parent attribute layout, the position in the parent attribute layout is given priority. The attributes and separators in that grid column on the inherited layout are shifted down, row by row, until an empty row is found. The original ordering of the grid rows is maintained. This position conflict resolution can result in attribute groups on subtypes not appearing as expected. After making changes to an attribute group in an attribute layout for a parent type, always inspect the same attribute group on all inherited attribute layouts for all child subtypes to ensure that they appear as expected. Make modifications as needed to the inherited attribute layouts to achieve the desired result. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "information": "Adding a Reusable Table to an Attribute Layout Reusable tables allow information to be grouped together as tabular data and be displayed on another type. In previous releases of PTC FlexPLM , reusable tables were referred to as multi-object tables. The reusable table itself is configured as a subtype of the Reusable Table type, then referenced by another Flex type using an alias attribute. When added to an attribute layout, the reusable table is displayed and can be edited in the end-user user interface. An example of a reusable table is a pitch sheet, which used to describe pattern components. For any given pattern, there could be any number of components. For example, a floral pattern could have multiple components (such as stems, petals, and centers), and each component could have its own color (such as green stems, yellow petals, and brown centers). Adding a reusable table to an attribute layout is accomplished in three main steps: 1. Define the reusable table. 2. On the type where you want to use the reusable table, create an alias attribute mapping to the reusable table. 3. On that same type, add the alias attribute as a Reusable Table layout element to the desired attribute layout. The Reusable Table layout element is only available to add to an attribute layout if there are one or more alias attributes mapping to a reusable table subtype present on the current type, which have not already been added as a Reusable Table layout element to the current attribute layout. These steps are described in detail below. 1. Define the reusable table. a. Under the Reusable Table type, use an existing reusable table, or create a subtype for your reusable table. For more information, see Creating a New Subtype . When you are creating the subtype, note the value of the Internal Name field. This value is needed when creating the alias attribute. A specific alias mapping can only be used once on a type or its subtypes. If a second alias attribute is defined with the same mapping, an error results. The Logical Attributes Report for a type contains mappings that have already been used for that type, including those used for alias attributes. For more information, see Logical Attributes Report . b. On the subtype, create attributes to populate the reusable table. These attributes represent the columns that users see in the table. For more information, see Creating a New Attribute . To adjust the order on your reusable table, reorder the attributes in the attribute layouts for the subtype by dragging and dropping them to the position you want in the Retail attribute layout. For more information, see Editing Attribute Layouts . 2. On the type where you want to create the reusable table, create a new alias attribute with the following settings: \u25e6 On the Define Attribute step, do the following: \u25aa Note the value you enter for the Internal Name field. This is needed when defining the alias attribute mapping. \u25aa From the Type list, select Alias . \u25e6 On the Choose Data Type step, select Object Reference . \u25e6 On the Set Properties step, do the following: \u25aa From the FlexPLM Attribute Type list, select Reusable Table or Iterated Reusable Table . \u25aa Iterated Reusable Table \u2014Tracks historical changes using date-based effectivity of each record in the table. \u25aa Reusable Table \u2014Does not track historical changes. Updates overwrite records in the table. \u25aa In the Mapping field, map this alias attribute to the reusable table subtype using the following syntax when the FlexPLM Attribute Type selection is Reusable Table : MBA|ownerReference[(' attribute name '=role)]@WCTYPE|com.lcs.wc.moa.LCSMOAObject| subtype When the FlexPLM Attribute Type selection is Iterated Reusable Table , use the following syntax: MBA|ownerReference[('ITERATED attribute name '=role)]@WCTYPE|com.lcs.wc.moa.LCSMOAObject| subtype In the above syntax examples, attribute name is the internal name of the current alias attribute, and subtype is the internal name of the Reusable Table subtype created in step 1. For example, if the internal name of the current alias attribute is pitchSheet , and the internal name of the Reusable Table subtype is com.ptc.PitchSheet_Multi-Object , and the FlexPLM Attribute Type selection is Reusable Table , then the Mapping field value is: MBA|ownerReference[('pitchSheet'=role)]@WCTYPE|com.lcs.wc.moa.LCSMOAObject|com.ptc.PitchSheet_Multi-Object If the internal name of the current alias attribute is pitchSheet , and the internal name of the Reusable Table subtype is com.ptc.PitchSheet_Multi-Object , and the FlexPLM Attribute Type selection is Iterated Reusable Table , then the Mapping field value is: MBA|ownerReference[('ITERATEDpitchSheet'=role)]@WCTYPE|com.lcs.wc.moa.LCSMOAObject|com.ptc.PitchSheet_Multi-Object 3. Add the alias attribute to the desired attribute layout. a. From the Layouts tab, select the Retail attribute layout. For descriptions of this layout, see Viewing an Attribute Layout . b. From the list below an existing layout element, select Reusable Table . c. Click Add . d. The Add a new layout element window contains all alias attributes that have been configured to map to reusable tables on the current type. Select an alias attribute and click OK . The reusable table layout element is added to the attribute layout. Because the layout of the reusable table itself is edited on the definition of the Reusable Table type, the definition pane for the reusable table layout element displays a reusable table icon. 4. Update the Group Display Name field as needed. The value of this field displays for the reusable table layout element in the end-user user interface. The system automatically populates the Group Display Name field with the internal name of the selected alias attribute. 5. To apply a custom style rule for this attribute group, specify the Background CSS Class value that maps to your custom style rule. For more information, see the description of the Background CSS Class in the table in Editing an Attribute Group . Apply custom style rules for attribute groups sparingly to place emphasis on attribute groups that truly require it. 6. Click Done .

            "information": "Attribute Properties Reference The properties on an attribute are determined by the attribute type and the data type of the attribute. Certain properties can only be set during attribute creation. Some object types have additional attribute properties defined. Because a data type is used by several attribute types, the system displays all properties that define any of these attributes. Therefore, you might see a property that does not apply to the attribute you have selected. For example, the Text Box Height field appears on all String data types even though it is only used by the Text Area attribute type. To determine the required fields for each attribute type, see PTC FlexPLM . The following table lists and describes the various attribute properties: Property Description Internal Name The internal name for the attribute. This is a required field and cannot be edited once the attribute is created. The name cannot contain hyphens, underscores, periods, slashes, spaces, tabs, or quotes. When creating a new attribute, you must ensure that the Internal Name value entered is not already in use by any PTC-provided attributes on any type or by any actions. This can be checked by using one of the following reports available from the Customization > Tools page: \u2022 Logical Attributes Report \u2022 Action For more information, see Logical Attributes Report . Display Name The display name for the attribute. By default, the display name is the same as the Internal Name . FlexPLM Attribute Type The PTC FlexPLM attribute type, described in plain text (for example, Derived String ). For more information, see Supported Data Types Alias (Value present for upgraded PTC FlexPLM systems only) The name for this attribute from the previous PTC FlexPLM release. This property is read-only. Filterable ( Object Reference and Version Reference data types only) Determines whether the attribute can be used in filtering the potential list of referenceable objects. Sequence Name ( Sequence data types only) Displays the database sequence used by the system to determine the values for numbering the sequence. Description A description for the attribute. Use Tool Tip Controls if a tool tip appears for the attribute. Tooltip Contains the text that appears when a user places the cursor over the attribute name on the Update page for the given attribute. User Groups ( User List data type for Local attributes, and Object Reference data type for Alias attributes, only) \u2022 User List data type\u2014Filters the list of selectable users based on one or more user groups. \u2022 Object Reference data type\u2014Identifies one or more groups of users allowed to moderate the discussion content. Unit Family ( Unit Of Measure data types only) Dictates the Displayable Units . For more information, see Unit of Measure . Displayable Units ( Unit Of Measure data types only) Unit of measure associated with a Unit Family . For more information, see Unit of Measure . Displayed Digits ( Unit Of Measure data types only) Numerical value for the number of digits displayed for each unit of measure. For more information, see Unit of Measure . Default to Current Date ( Date and Time data types only) Sets the default value of the attribute to the current date, as of the creation of the object instance Sort List Alphabetically ( Multi Entry and Composite data types only) Specifies if the user-entered or user-selected list of values is to be sorted in alphabetical order. Currency Symbol ( Real Number data types only) Determines if a numeric value is to be displayed in currency format. The default for this property is No . Decimal Digits Displayed ( Real Number data types only) Specifies the number of decimal points that can be displayed. If the user enters a value, the value must be between 0 and 6 digits. If left blank, the value defaults to 0 and no decimals are displayed in the user interface. Users can enter additional decimal digits; however, the system only displays the number specified in this attribute. Mapping ( Alias attribute types) The Reusable Table type for which this attribute is an alias. This is a required property. For PTC FlexPLM , this is only used for reusable tables. For information on the syntax for the Mapping property value, see Adding a Reusable Table to an Attribute Layout . Unique ( String data types only) If set to Yes , requires the system to validate that the value for this attribute is different for all object instances for the given type. In the case of derived string attributes, the system validates that the evaluated results of derived string equations are different for each derived attribute. If set to No , you can have multiple object instances with the same value for this attribute, including the same equation for derived string attributes. Formula ( Calculated attribute types, Derived String data types, and Derived Numeric data types only) On calculated, derived string, and derived numeric attributes, the formula determines the derived attribute value. For more information, see Formulas . Enabled If set to Yes , allows users to use the attribute. If set to No , displays the attribute but does not allow users to use it. Editable on Create Controls the ability to edit the value of this attribute when creating an instance of the associated type. Editable on Update Controls the ability to edit the value of this attribute when updating an instance of the associated type. Searchable Controls the ability to use the attribute as search criteria when searching the associated type library using the default filter (no user-defined filter selected). In addition to setting the Searchable property and including the attribute in the Retail Search Criteria attribute layout, the administrator must also ensure the attribute is included in the Retail layout. If the attribute is not included in the Retail layout, it is considered a hidden attribute and is not visible when the Retail Search Criteria layout is used to render the search criteria page. Search Criteria Default Value If you enter a value in this field, the system automatically uses this value as the default search criteria value for the attribute when the attribute is included in the search criteria, and searching the object library for the corresponding type. You can manually change this search value. Leaving this field blank allows you to enter a search value during a library search. Specifying a value in this field does not prevent end users from overriding the default search criteria value. In Search Results Displays or hides the attribute and its associated value when displaying search results for the associated type. Selecting this checkbox also automatically displays this attribute for the given type when viewing search results and no view is selected. Mass Change (When Applicable) Controls if users can perform a mass change or search and replace on the attribute when updating search results for the associated type. To enable the mass change and search and replace functionality, you must also select the Table Editable checkbox. Table Editable Controls editing the attribute value in the search results table. This checkbox must be selected to enable the mass change and search and replace functionality. Table Wrap-able Controls the display of the text in the search results table. Text can either be wrapped or displayed on one line. If it is displayed on one line and the text exceeds the width of the column, it does not appear in the column. Table Min Wrap Width Defines the minimum cell width for attribute wrapping Quick Info Attribute Displays or hides the local attribute and its instance value in the Quick Info pop-up. This property may appear on all attribute types in the type manager. However, PTC FlexPLM only respects it for local attribute definitions. Setting it on other attribute types will have no effect. Data Type The data type of the attribute, described as code (for example, java.lang.String ). For more information, see Supported Data Types . This property is read-only. Database Columns ( Local attribute data types only) Displays the names of the database columns in which the attribute resides on the modeled class for the type. This property is read-only. Input Field Type ( String data types only) Specified whether the input field for the attribute is to be single line or multiple lines. Possible values: \u2022 Single Line \u2014 a text box is rendered for this attribute. \u2022 Multiple Lines \u2014a text area is rendered for this attribute. Other Side Class ( Object Reference and Version Reference data types only) The internal name of the object type that can be assigned as a value for the reference attribute. For example, wt.org.WTUser (the internal name of the User type). This is a required property. For more information, see Object Reference and Version Reference . Other Side Attribute ( Object Reference and Version Reference data types only)The internal name of the attribute on the Other Side Class to be used when rendering the value of the reference attribute. For example, last (the internal name for the Last Name attribute on the User type). This is a required property. For more information, see Object Reference and Version Reference . Synchronized ( Product , Colorway , Product Cost Sheet , Colorway Cost Sheet , Product Season Link , and Colorway-Season Link types only) Select Yes when creating a new attribute to create a synchronized attribute definition .

Each symbol within a given care/wash family must be assigned a unique sequential value within that family. C Numbers this particular care/wash symbol as C . <web root path of image file> Tells the system where the image is stored. /Windchill/rfa/images/carewash/dryC.bmp Tells the system that the image file for this element is located through the /Windchill/rfa/images/carewash/dryC.bmp path. <care/wash list element name> Tumble dry, no heat Names this element as Tumble dry, no heat . The system displays this name when displaying the associated image. Once you have entered all of the required configuration lines in the carewash.config file, you must perform the following steps: 1. In a Windchill shell, run the following Java class file: windchill com.lcs.wc.carewash.CareWashManager . This generates the requested javascript file carewash_symbols.js at <WT_HOME>\\codebase\\rfa\\javascript\\ . 2. Restart the PTC HTTP Server (powered by Apache).

Each attribute in a set is directly or indirectly related to another attribute in the set through cascading attribute rules, as a driver or driven attribute, and is not related to an attribute in any other attribute set. Attributes that are not driver or driven attributes (that is, attributes that are not involved in any cascading attribute rules) do not appear in any attribute set. The Attribute Set Report provides a read-only tree display of the possible values for an attribute. The following factors combine to determine the possible values for the attributes in an attribute set: \u2022 There can be multiple cascading attribute rules defined on the Cascading Attributes tab for a type. \u2022 There can be multiple constraints defined on the Constraints tab on the attribute information page for the attributes involved in those cascading attribute rules. \u2022 Multiple rules can be part of a single cascading attribute set, and it is not always obvious when individual rules are related. \u2022 Not all values from the backing global enumerations are selectable. Only those values in the Available for selection list are included in the Attribute Set Report . The values displayed in the Attribute Set Report are the values that will be available for selection in the end-user user interface, based on the intersection of the cascading attribute rules and the constraints defined on the attributes involved in those rules. This allows an administrator to quickly identify any problems that result from the combination of cascading attribute rules and constraints: \u2022 An attribute could be over-constrained, meaning that there are conflicting rules or constraints so that no value is possible. \u2022 An attribute could be under-constrained, meaning that there are too many values, and no finite set of values can be determined. \u2022 There could be legitimately no legal values for an attribute, because a constraint or rule had been deliberately defined that way.

            "information": "Enumerations and Cascading Attribute Rules To be eligible for use in a cascading attribute rule, an attribute must have a string data type , and a single, enabled enumerated value list constraint directly backed by a global enumeration. To be directly backed by a global enumeration, the enumerated value list constraint must have been created using an existing global enumeration . Other enumerated value list constraints can be present on the attribute, and the attribute can still be eligible for use in cascading attribute rules as long the other enumerated value list constraints meet one of the following criteria: \u2022 The enumerated value list constraint is directly backed by a global enumeration, but is disabled. If more than one such enumerated value list constraint is enabled, the attribute becomes ineligible for use in new cascading attribute rules. \u2022 The enumerated value list constraint is local ( an entirely new enumeration was created on this attribute ). \u2022 The enumerated value list constraint is based on an existing global enumeration . If an attribute used in a cascading attribute rule later becomes ineligible, any cascading attribute rules including that attribute remain unchanged. For example, the attribute could become ineligible if the single, enabled enumerated value list constraint directly backed by a global enumeration is deleted, or a second enumerated value list constraint directly backed by a global enumeration is enabled. The rule, including the condition with the now ineligible attribute, can be edited to change the values selected for that condition, but if the now ineligible attribute is removed from the condition, it cannot be added elsewhere in the rule. For more information on creating enumerated value list constraints, see Enumerated Value List Constraints Displaying the Backing Enumeration for an Attribute in a Cascading Attribute Rule When an attribute is selected from the drop-down list for an If or And If condition or the Then clause of a cascading attribute rule in the New Rule or Edit Rule window, the name of the global enumeration that is backing the enumerated value list constraint is displayed in the Enumeration field below the drop-down list. The backing enumeration in effect when the cascading attribute rule was created or edited is saved with the rule. Editing the attribute itself to change the global enumeration referenced by the enumerated value list constraint, or changing the enumerated value list constraint itself does not change the backing enumeration on any existing cascading attribute rules. Any new cascading attribute rules use the currently enabled backing enumeration, and display it in the Enumeration field. Global Enumerations Global enumerations are created and managed from the Manage Global Enumerations window of the Type and Attribute Management utility. Both root enumerations (the top-level enumeration directly under an organizer in the Manage Global Enumerations window) and their subenumerations can be used as backing enumerations for attributes eligible for use in cascading attribute rules. For each global enumeration, the enumeration entries are included in either the Available for selection table, or the Removed from selection list table. These tables determine whether the entries are visible and selectable in the end-user user interface when the value list is used by an attribute. Entries in the Available for selection table are selectable in the end-user interface, while entries in the Removed from selection list table are not selectable in the end-user interface. These tables have no impact on the availability of the enumeration entries for cascading attribute rules. All entries in the backing global enumeration are available to be selected for cascading attribute rules in the New Rule , Edit Rule , and Edit Condition windows. Only those entries in the Available for selection table for an enumeration, however, can appear in the Attribute Set Report for the attribute or be available for selection in the end-user user interface when the value list is used by an attribute. As a result, cascading attribute rules can be defined for all entries in an enumeration, and the backing enumeration can be edited to determine which entries are or are not selectable at any given time, without the need to manipulate the cascading attribute rules. If entries are added to a root enumeration, they are automatically inherited by all subenumerations of that root enumeration, and are added to the Removed from selection list table of the subenumerations. Similarly, if entries are deleted from a root enumeration, they are automatically deleted from all subenumerations of that root enumeration. If entries are added to an enumeration which is used as the backing enumeration for any part of an existing cascading attribute rule, those entries are added to the rule as unselected values. The sort order of the enumeration entries in the Available for selection table and Removed from selection list table determines the order in which values are presented for selection in the Select Values list on the New Rule , Edit Rule , or Edit Condition windows for attributes backed by the enumeration. It also determines the order in which the selected values are listed for the Then clause on the Cascading Attributes tab, and the order of the values when presented in the Attribute Set Report window. If there are entries in both tables, the Select Values list displays the entries in the Available for selection table first, followed by the entries in the Removed from selection list table. Changing the sort order on the global enumeration changes the order of values presented in Select Values lists, the Cascading Attributes tab, and the Attribute Set Report window as well.

            "information": "Inherited Rules Cascading attribute rules on a parent type are inherited by all subtypes. The inheritance icon displays next to each node in the tree containing inherited rules. Local rules are cascading attribute rules created directly on the current type. Only rules created locally on the current type can be edited or deleted; inherited rules can only be edited or deleted on the parent type where they are defined. Because the type hierarchy can be many levels deep, rules can be inherited from the immediate parent type or an ancestor type many levels above the subtype in the type hierarchy. In the following graphic, both inherited and local rules are present where Color is the driving attribute. Hiding and Showing Inherited Rules The drop-down list next to the Find in tree search field displays the icon for the current state of inherited rules, either hidden or shown, and the action to change that state is selectable from the drop-down list: \u2022 \u2014displays when inherited rules are shown. Select the Hide Inherited Rules action from the drop-down list to hide inherited rules. \u2022 \u2014displays when inherited rules are hidden. Select the Show Inherited Rules action from the drop-down list to show inherited rules. The following graphic shows the same Cascading Attributes tree, with inherited rules hidden. Only the local rules are shown. Even when hidden, when inherited rules are enabled, they are still in effect. If inherited rules are hidden, using the Find in tree search field or attempting to enable inherited rules causes the system to prompt you to clear the Hide Inherited Rules filter to proceed. Disabling and Enabling Inherited Rules Disable inherited rules if your business requirements dictate that any cascading attribute rule must differ between the parent type and the subtype in either of the following ways: \u2022 different backing global enumerations referenced by an If condition, And If condition, or the Then clause. \u2022 different selectable values set for an If condition, And If condition, or the Then clause. Once inherited rules are disabled, the cascading attribute rules tree must be entirely rebuilt on the subtype with locally defined rules. By default, inherited rules are always enabled, meaning that rules inherited from all parent types are in effect on the current type, as well as any locally created cascading attribute rules. Inherited rules can be disabled by clicking the disable inherited rules icon . Disabling inherited rules leaves only locally created cascading attribute rules in effect for the current type and any subtypes of the current type. When inherited rules are disabled on the current type, subtypes of the current type inherit rules only from the current type. Inherited rules that have been disabled can be re-enabled by clicking the enable inherited rules icon . Subtypes of a type which has disabled inherited rules can later explicitly enable inherited rules, in which case they inherit the rules from all ancestor types, including the type which has disabled inherited rules. When inherited rules are enabled, cascading attribute rules cannot be created or edited on a subtype in a way that results in circular dependencies on that subtype. Rules can be created and edited on parent types that result in circular dependencies on subtypes which inherit those rules. If enabling inherited rules on a subtype results in circular dependencies with locally created rules, a message warning of the circular dependencies displays on the Cascading Attributes tab. The subtype can be saved with those circular dependencies in effect. Similarly, if rules created or edited on a parent type result in circular dependencies on a subtype which inherits those rules, the warning message is displayed on the subtype the next time the subtype is viewed. The message remains on the Cascading Attributes tab for the subtype until all circular dependencies are addressed. After making changes to the rules for a parent type, always inspect the rules for any subtypes with inherited rules enabled, to make sure that the rules appear as expected. Modify rules on the subtypes as needed. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "information": "Circular Dependencies A circular dependency occurs when the attribute selected for the Then clause of a cascading attribute rule (the driven attribute) directly or indirectly drives one or more of the attributes you have selected for an If or And If condition of the same rule. This means that another cascading attribute rule or chain of cascading attribute rules exist where the attribute you are trying to set as the driven attribute for the rule already drives one or more of the attributes you are trying to set as driver attributes. These existing rules can be local rules created on the current type, or rules inherited from a parent type . The system does not allow you to create new rules, or edit existing rules on the current type in a way that would result in a circular dependency. The system does not prevent creating new rules or editing existing rules on a parent type in such a way that results in a circular dependency on a subtype. In this scenario, when you next view the Cascading Attributes tab for the subtype, a message displays alerting you that circular dependencies now exist. The subtype can be saved with those circular dependencies in effect. After making changes to the rules for a parent type, always inspect the rules for any subtypes with inherited rules enabled, to make sure that the rules appear as expected. Modify rules on the subtypes as needed. For example, assume that the following cascading attribute rules are created on a subtype: \u2022 If Class=Bottoms, then Sub-Class=Skirts, Jeans \u2022 If Sub-Class=Skirts, then Item Type=Pleated, Pencil Creating the following cascading attribute rule on the parent type would result in a circular dependency: \u2022 If Item Type=Pencil, then Class=Bottoms The Attribute Set Report cannot run if there are circular dependencies on the current type. To fix circular dependencies resulting from inherited rules, you can do one or more of the following: \u2022 Update or delete the rules created locally on the subtype to correct the circular dependency. \u2022 Update or delete the rules created on the parent type that are causing the circular dependency on the subtype. Because the type hierarchy can be many levels deep, the problem rules can be on the immediate parent type or an ancestor type many levels above the subtype in the type hierarchy. \u2022 Disable inherited rules on the subtype where circular dependencies now exist.

To create a new cascading attribute rule: 1. In edit mode , launch the New Rule window in one of the following ways: \u25e6 Click the new rule icon on the toolbar of the Cascading Attributes tree . The New Rule window opens, with no attributes or values pre-selected. \u25e6 Select New Rule from the right-click actions menu of an If , And If , or Then node in the cascading attributes tree.

Create all cascading attribute rules for a scenario before using them. Assume that you have three attributes on the Product/Apparel type: Class , Sub-Class , and Item Type . You want to create a set of cascading attribute rules so that the values of the Class attribute to drive the available values for the Sub-Class attribute, and the values of the Sub-Class attribute drive the available values for the Item Type attribute, as shown in the following table: Class Sub-Class Item Type Bottoms Skirts Pleated Pencil Jeans Cargo Five Pocket Pencil One Piece Dresses Wraps Gowns Outerwear Coats Midweight Jackets Trenches Lightweight Jackets Assume the following: \u2022 The Class , Sub-Class , and Item Type attributes exist on the Product/Apparel type. \u2022 Global enumerations have been created with the desired values for each of the attributes. \u2022 A single, enabled enumerated value list constraint has been created for each of the attributes, using the existing global enumerations. For more information, see Enumerations and Cascading Attribute Rules . First, create cascading attribute rules one level down the cascading attributes tree (from Class to Sub-Class ): \u2022 If Class = Bottoms, then Sub-Class = Skirts, Jeans \u2022 If Class = One Piece, then Sub-Class = Dresses \u2022 If Class = Outerwear, then Sub-Class = Coats Then create rules that represent two levels down the cascading attributes tree ( Class to Sub-Class to Item Type ): \u2022 If Class = Bottoms, and if Sub-Class = Skirts, then Item Type = Pleated, Pencil \u2022 If Class = Bottoms, and if Sub-Class = Jeans, then Item Type = Cargo, Five Pocket, Pencil \u2022 If Class = One Piece and if Sub-Class = Dresses, then Item Type = Wraps, Gowns \u2022 If Class = Outerwear and if Sub-Class = Coats, then Item Type = Midweight Jackets, Trenches, Lightweight Jacket You must create rules that represent one level down the tree, because the Attribute Set Report is generated by looking at the intersection of all cascading attribute rules and constraints defined on the attributes involved in the attribute set. If these rules are not created, the report does not understand that certain values for Sub-Class are constrained by certain values of Class. For example: If the rule \"If Class = Bottoms, then Sub-Class = Skirts, Jeans\" is not created, the system thinks that all values of Sub-Class are valid for all values of Class . This is true even though we have the rule: \"If Class = Bottoms, and if Sub-Class = Skirts, then Item Type = Pleated, Pencil\" because this rule only specifies when the Item Type values of \"Pleated\" and \"Pencil\" are selectable. This rule does not specify when the \"Skirts\" value for Sub-Class is selectable. For more information, see Attribute Set Report . Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

The string values can be either literal values or references to other system attributes. For example, you could have an attribute called Long Description that is a combination of the Short Description and Style ID attributes, which are created by an end user. When viewing the attribute, derived string attributes appear as the string value. The system generates this value when creating or updating an object. When updating the attribute, you see the attribute label and the string Derived From Other Attributes , which indicates that this attribute is a derived attribute. It later populates with the information you have input in other attributes. After saving, the system evaluates the expression defined in the formula property of the attribute definition and populates the attributes value with the result of the evaluated expression. Derived Numeric When certain Integer Number data types and Real Number data types have a Formula property that contains information, these attributes are called derived numeric attributes because the values set on object instances are derived from the expression specified in the formula property. The Integer Number data type must have a FlexPLM Attribute Type of Integer , and the Real Number data type must have a FlexPLM Attribute Type of Float or Currency . The derived numeric attribute type allows you to create a single value from a combination of other attributes and operators. Operators include but are not limited to plus, minus, division, and multiplication symbols. For more information, see the \u201cSupported Operators\u201d section in Formulas . For example, you could have an attribute called Total Revenue that is calculated by multiplying the Retail Price and Sales Volume attributes, which are set by an end user. When viewing the attribute, derived string attributes appear as the formula value. The system generates this value when creating or updating an object. When updating the attribute, you see the attribute label and the string Derived From Other Attributes , which indicates that this attribute is a derived attribute. After saving, the system evaluates the expression defined in the formula property of the attribute definition and populates the attribute value with the result of the evaluated expression. Calculated Attributes Calculated attributes are used to represent attributes that have a constant numeric value. Calculated attributes allow you to set the attribute value to a given decimal value. Calculated attributes are created using formulas. The formulas can only contain constants (decimal numbers). Calculated attributes can be used by other attributes.

            "title": "Mapped Attributes",
            "information": "Mapped Attributes Overview Mapped attributes are used to facilitate planning in PTC FlexPLM . This functionality enables users to define what products to offer for a given season. For example, a company might want to offer five different sweaters for the winter season. When product line managers create a plan, they can create placeholders. Placeholders are intended product offerings generated from the plan. The placeholder captures what is needed by the merchant. It acts as a way to communicate requirements with designers, developers, sourcing managers, material managers, and so on. A placeholder represents each line item in the plan. For example, each sweater offered in a season is a line item. Each sweater could have a different price point, color selection, fabric, design, gender, or other characteristics. These characteristics are represented by attributes. Mapped attributes enable administrators to configure attributes on a product. Those attributes from the product are mapped to a placeholder. When a product is created for a placeholder, that attribute can be automatically populated, and the values are equivalent to those on the placeholder. Data originates with a plan. The data is inherited by placeholders, and it is ultimately inherited by products. In the user interface, the mapped attribute appears on the placeholder. When users create a product on that placeholder, the mapped attribute automatically appears on the product, using the same attribute value they selected on the placeholder. The value is locked and cannot be changed. This prevents users from associating products where the mapped attributes are not the same (for example, you would not want to associate sweatpants to a sweater).

            "information": "Enabling Enumeration Access for Non-Administrative Users Non-administrative users can be granted access to edit enumerations without having permissions to manage types. These users can manage global enumerations and enumeration organizers in the Type and Attribute Management utility. \u2022 In the PTC FlexPLM user interface, non-administrator enumeration managers only see the Manage Attribute Value Lists link under the Administrative section of the left navigation pane. They can click that link to launch the Type and Attribute Management utility in the site context. \u2022 In the Type and Attribute Management utility, they only have access to the Manage Global Enumerations tab where they can create, modify, and delete enumerations and enumeration organizers. They do not have access to the Manage Types tab. \u2022 They can see all enumeration organizers in the system. They might or might not have permission to create, modify, or delete enumeration organizers, depending on their access. \u2022 They have permission to create, modify, change the domain, and delete global enumerations belonging to a domain in which they have been given permission to do so. For enumeration managers to see the Manage Global Enumerations tab, they must belong to a profile that gives access to the Manage Global Enumerations action. To perform operations on enumeration organizers and enumerations, enumeration managers must be given certain access control permissions. Setting Up a Non-Administrative User as an Enumeration Manager Follow these steps to set up a non-administrative user to be an enumeration manager. 1. If the Enumeration Managers group does not exist already, create a group for enumeration managers. It is easier to add and remove people to and from a group to control their access, rather than defining the access on a domain for each person. In PTC FlexPLM , the Enumeration Managers group is available out-of-the-box. If you have only one enumeration manager, you do not need to create a group. Continue to the next step. a. Under Administrative , click Manage Users , and then click Site Users to launch the Participant Administration utility. b. Click the create new group icon . c. In the New Group window, in the Name field, type Enumeration Managers . d. Complete the other fields in the Set Attributes step as needed and click Next . e. Add users or groups to the Enumeration Managers group on the Add Members step. f. Click Finish . You can edit the Enumeration Managers group later to add or remove users as needed. For more information, see \u201cCreating a New Group\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . 2. If the Enumeration Managers profile does not exist already, create a profile for enumeration managers and grant visibility to the Manage Global Enumerations action. In PTC FlexPLM , the Enumeration Managers profile is available out-of-the-box. a. Under Administrative , click Manage User/Group Profiles . b. Click the new profile icon . c. In the New Profile window, in the Name field, enter Enumeration Managers as the name for your profile. d. In the Description field, enter a description of your profile. e. In the Set Action Visibility step, select the Global checkbox next to the Manage Global Enumerations action. f. In the Select Members step, add the Enumeration Managers group to the profile. Click the add members to profile icon , search for the group, add it to the participant list, and click OK . g. Click Finish . For more information, see \u201cCreating a New Profile\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . 3. Grant the Enumeration Managers group permissions on the LWCOrganizer object type. a. Launch the Policy Administration utility: a. Under Administrative , click Manage User/Group Profiles . b. Under the Context column for the Enumeration Managers group, click Site . c. Under Business Administration , click Policy Administration . b. Select the System (Site) domain and click Update . All enumeration organizers are associated with the System (Site) domain, so the permissions you give apply to all enumeration organizers, no matter what their owning organization is. c. In the Administrative Domain client, click the Access Control tab and then click Create to create a new access control rule. d. In the Access Control Rule window, select the LWCOrganizer type. e. Under the Groups tab, select the Enumeration Managers group and click Add . The Enumeration Managers group appears in the Selected Principal field. f. In the Permissions field, under the Grant column, select Read to give the Enumeration Managers group the ability to view enumeration organizers. If you want to allow members of the Enumeration Managers group to perform additional operations on enumeration organizers, you can give them additional permissions on the LWCOrganizer type. For examples of permissions, see \u201cAccess Control Permissions Needed for Enumeration Organizer Actions\u201d section below. Any users who need access to enumerations need Read , Modify , and Create permissions on the LWCOrganizer in the System (Site) domain. g. Click Apply . For more information, see \u201cCreating and Updating Access Control Rules\u201d in the Windchill Help Center . 4. Grant the Enumeration Managers group permissions on the LWCLocalizablePropertyValue object type. a. In the Access Control Rule window, select the LWCLocalizablePropertyValue type. b. In the Selected Principal field, select the Enumeration Managers group. c. Under the Grant column, select the appropriate permissions required by the group. For examples, see \u201cAccess Control Permissions Needed for Enumeration Organizer Actions\u201d section below. d. Click Apply . 5. Grant the Enumeration Managers group permissions on the LWCEnumerationDefinition object type. \u25e6 If all the enumeration managers are responsible for the same set of domains, do the following: 1. Launch the Administrative Domain client for each domain to which you want to give access. 2. Give the Enumeration Managers group the appropriate permissions for the actions required on the LWCEnumerationDefinition object type. For examples of permissions, see \u201cAccess Control Permissions Needed for Enumeration Organizer Actions\u201d section below. 3. Assign each enumeration manager to the group by editing the group or user in the Participant Administration client. \u25e6 If different users are responsible for the enumerations in different domains, and more than one user is responsible for a given set of domains, do the following: 1. Set up one or more additional groups for enumeration managers. Each group is responsible for managing the enumerations in one set of domains. 2. Set up each of the additional groups as members of the parent Enumeration Managers group. 3. Using the Administrative Domain client for each domain, give each group the permissions for the LWCEnumerationDefinition object type. For examples of permissions, see \u201cAccess Control Permissions Needed for Enumeration Organizer Actions\u201d section below. 4. Assign individual users to the appropriate group. \u25e6 If different users are responsible for the enumerations in different domains, but only one user is responsible for a given set of domains, do the following: 1. Assign each user who is to be a manager to the Enumeration Managers group. 2. Give each user the appropriate permissions for the LWCEnumerationDefinition object type in the domains for which they are responsible. For examples of permissions, see \u201cAccess Control Permissions Needed for Enumeration Organizer Actions\u201d section below.

These properties include certain properties on types, attributes, enumerations, and enumeration entries, as well as attribute layout element properties. Properties with localizable values are identified by a localize icon to the right of the property value field. Clicking the localize icon next to a property opens the Localize window. The values of these properties can be edited only from the Localize window. If a localizable attribute property value is inherited from a parent type, the inheritance must be removed by clearing the inheritance checkbox before the property value can be edited in the Localize window. If you open the Localize window while in view mode, the values are read-only. If you open the Localize window while in edit mode, and the property value is not inherited from a parent type, the master text and localized values can be edited. If the property value is inherited from a parent type, then the values in the Localize window are read-only, even in edit mode. The Localize window identifies the property and the type, attribute, layout, enumeration or enumeration entry on which the property resides. The current master text for that property value is provided in the Master Text field. The Languages table below the Master Text field displays the available installed language locales, and the translations (where present) of the master text for each installed locale. If the value for a localizable property is entered during the creation of the type, attribute, enumeration, or enumeration entry, that value becomes the master text for the property. All locale values are left blank. Once the type, attribute, enumeration, or enumeration entry has been created, the localizable property can be edited only from the Localize window. The value displayed for the property in the Type and Attribute Management utility or the end-user user interface is determined by the browser locale of the current user and the installed languages in the system: \u2022 If the browser locale matches an installed language, and there is a translation provided in the Localize window for that language, that translation displays for the property. \u2022 If the browser locale matches an installed language, but there is no translation provided in the Localize window for that language, the Master Text value displays for the property. \u2022 If there is no Master Text for the property, then no value displays for the property in the Type and Attribute Management utility or the end-user user interface. If there is no match between the browser locale and the installed languages, then the browser locale is assumed to be en_US , and the value displayed for the property is determined as described in the previous bullet points. To edit a property with localizable values, use the following procedure: 1. Select Edit from the Actions menu to enter edit mode. 2. If the property value is inherited, the inheritance must be removed by clearing the inheritance checkbox before the property can be edited. 3. Click the localize icon next to the property. 4.

The following synchronized type pairings support synchronized attributes: \u2022 Product ( com.lcs.wc.product.LCSProduct ) and Colorway ( com.lcs.wc.product.LCSSKU ) \u2022 Cost Sheet Product ( com.lcs.wc.sourcing.LCSProductCostSheet ) and Cost Sheet Colorway ( com.lcs.wc.sourcing.LCSSKUCostSheet ) \u2022 Product Season Link ( com.lcs.wc.season.LCSProductSeasonLink ) and Colorway-Season Link ( com.lcs.wc.season.LCSSKUSeasonLink ) A synchronized attribute is not reproduced across all types in the synchronized type set. It is only reproduced between the two types defined in the synchronized type pairing. To make an attribute synchronized on one of the synchronized type pairings listed above, set the Synchronized property during attribute creation. Select Yes for the Synchronized property on the Set Properties step of the New Attribute window when creating the attribute. When the Synchronized property is set to Yes , the new attribute is automatically created on both the primary and secondary types of the synchronized type pair. By default, the Synchronized property is set to No . Once the synchronized attribute has been created, the synchronization cannot be removed. Instead, you must delete the synchronized attribute, and create a new, non-synchronized attribute. When editing the properties of a synchronized attribute in the Type and Attribute Management utility, if a property value is changed, the change is automatically reflected in the attribute definition on the other type. In the PTC FlexPLM client, the values of synchronized attributes are inheritable from the primary type ( Product ) to the secondary type ( Colorway ). The inherited value on the secondary type can also be overridden. Starting in FlexPLM 11.1 M010, the inherited value is persisted on the Colorway object. So any custom code including but not limited to Server-Side Plug-ins will need to take this into account. The inherited value changes are propagated from the product level to the colorway level using a POST_UPDATE_PERSIST Server-Side Plug-in (POST_CREATE_PERSIST for LCSProductSeasonLink) with a priority of 1. So any custom plug-ins that fire for the product level object, and access or change the related Colorway level objects will need to run after this plug-in. The standard priority of 1000 will ensure the custom plug-ins run after this plug-in. Clearing the Colorway level value will cause the product level value to be set on the Colorway object. It is possible to configure an attribute in the type manager to be both synchronized and derived. It is also possible to define a derived attribute whose formula includes a synchronized attribute definition. However, these configurations are not supported because the concepts of derived and synchronized are conflicting and the derived attribute may generate incorrect data. Derived attributes are derived as a server behavior where a value is calculated for the attribute based on the formula that is specified in the definition of the attribute. The derivation happens only when some value on the instance is updated. If no updates are made to the instance, the value of the derived attribute does not change. If you require derived behavior for a synchronized attribute definition, or if you require derived behavior for a non-synchronized attribute that includes synchronized attributes in its formula, it is recommended that you create a server-side plug-in customization to implement the custom requirements.

            "title": "Synchronized Types",
            "information": "Synchronized Types PTC FlexPLM uses synchronized types when multiple types share the same type tree hierarchy. For example, Product and SKU or Colorway, Material and Material-Supplier. Multiple types are grouped together in a synchronized type set because they are related from a business perspective. Each synchronized type set is made up of a primary and one or more secondary types. For customers upgrading from a release prior to version 10.2 of PTC FlexPLM , synchronized types replace the concept of scope and level. In a synchronized type set, type hierarchy changes in one type hierarchy are automatically reflected on the other type. For example: \u2022 Measurements (primary) and Measurements POM (secondary) are a synchronized type set. \u2022 Whenever you create a new subtype of Measurements , a corresponding subtype of Measurements POM is automatically created. Likewise, whenever you create a new subtype of Measurements POM , a corresponding subtype of Measurements is automatically created. \u2022 Whenever you delete a subtype of Measurements , the corresponding subtype of Measurements POM is automatically deleted. Likewise, whenever you delete a subtype of Measurements POM , the corresponding subtype of Measurements is automatically deleted. Certain synchronized type pairings support synchronized attributes.

The attributes used in an If or And If condition are considered to be driver attributes, while the attribute used in a Then clause is considered to be a driven attribute. The If and And If attributes drive the value of the Then attribute. When defining cascading attributes the following rules apply: \u2022 All attributes must be defined as FlexPLM Variable Type \u201cDriven\u201d, while you can select attributes that are defined as type Single List, however, this capability is not supported. \u25e6 FlexPLM supports one and only one use case and that is the use case where all members of the cascading attribute set (ie. the Driven attribute set) are defined as FlexPLM variable type \u201cDriven\u201d \u2022 ALL attributes in the driven rule set must be defined as synchronized YES, OR, synchronized NO, they cannot be a mix. \u25e6 There is system level synchronization code that tries to replicate rules on the SKU level when defining rules on the product level for synchronized attributes, therefore the synchronized property value of an attribute definition must be consistent for all members of the cascading attribute set in order for the system generated rules to be successfully created. For example, a site could define the following cascading attribute rules: \u2022 If Class=Bottoms, then Sub-Class=Skirts, Jeans \u2022 If Class=One Piece, then Sub-Class=Dresses \u2022 If Class=Bottoms, and if Sub-Class=Jeans, then Item Type=Cargo, Five Pocket, Pencil This means that when a user selects a value of Bottoms for the Class attribute, then the values available for the Sub-Class attribute are limited to Skirts and Jeans, but if the user instead selects a value of One Piece for the Class attribute, then the available value for the Sub-Class attribute is Dresses. Additionally, if a user selects a value of Bottoms for the Class attribute, and a value of Jeans for the Sub-Class attribute, then the values available for the Item Type attribute are Cargo, Five Pocket, and Pencil. To be used in a cascading attribute rule, an attribute must have a string data type, and a single, enabled enumerated value list constraint directly backed by a global enumeration. For more information, see Enumerations and Cascading Attribute Rules . For PTC FlexPLM to recognize the attributes in a cascading attribute set, the type must be set Driven . The Cascading Attributes tab of the type information page displays a tree of all of the cascading attribute rules that have been defined for attributes on the current type. Each top-level node in the tree is the driver attribute in one or more cascading attribute rules. Expand each top-level attribute node to see the If and And If driver attributes for the rules nested as intermediate nodes, ending with the Then clause with its corresponding driven attribute as the leaf node of the tree. A cascading attribute rule is displayed under the top-level attribute of its primary If condition. When multiple rules use the same driver attributes, these overlapping driver attributes are displayed as a single node. Additional driver attributes (for more complex rules) and the driven attributes for each rule display as nodes beneath. If there are no values specified for the Then clause of a cascading attribute rule, then No Legal Values displays for the leaf node of that rule. From the Cascading Attributes tree you can take the following actions: \u2022 Expand or collapse all nodes in the tree by clicking the expand all icon or the collapse all icon . \u2022 Expand or collapse individual nodes in the tree by clicking the expand icon or collapse icon next to the node. \u2022 Create a new rule by clicking the new rule icon or by selecting the New Rule action from the right-click actions menu of an If , And If , or Then node. For more information, see Creating a New Cascading Attribute Rule . \u2022 View the complete set of values that a user would encounter in the user-interface based on the cascading attribute rules and attribute constraints by clicking the attribute set report icon . For more information, see Attribute Set Report . \u2022 Enable and disable rules inherited from a parent type by clicking the enable inherited rules icon or disable inherited rules icon . For more information, see Inherited Rules . \u2022 Hide and show rules inherited from a parent type by selecting the Hide Inherited Rules action or Show Inherited Rules from the drop-down-list next to the Find in tree search field. The icon displayed for the drop-down list identifies the current state of inherited rules, either hidden or shown, and the action to change that state is selectable from the drop-down list: \u25e6 \u2014displays when inherited rules are shown. Select the Hide Inherited Rules action from the drop-down list to hide inherited rules. \u25e6 \u2014displays when inherited rules are hidden. Select the Show Inherited Rules action from the drop-down list to show inherited rules. Inherited rules are indicated with the inheritance icon . For more information, see Inherited Rules . \u2022 Edit an existing condition by selecting Edit Condition from the right-click actions menu of an If or And If node. For more information, see Editing a Cascading Attribute Rule Condition . \u2022 Edit an existing rule by selecting Edit Rule from the right-click actions menu of a Then node. For more information, see Editing a Cascading Attribute Rule . \u2022 Delete existing rules by selecting Delete Rules from the right-click actions menu of an If , And If , or Then node. Only locally created rules can be deleted; rules inherited from a parent type cannot be deleted. The location where the delete action is invoked determines the extent of what is deleted: \u25e6 When invoked from a Then clause leaf node, only the specific cascading attribute rule for that Then clause is deleted. If that is the only rule applicable for any of the intermediate tree nodes ( If , or And If ), then those nodes are deleted. Otherwise, the intermediate nodes remain. \u25e6 When invoked from an intermediate If or And If condition node, all rules with the same set of If or And If conditions are deleted. \u25e6 If all And If and Then nodes under an If node are deleted, the If node is deleted as well. The actions available for the Cascading Attributes tree are only available in edit mode .

            "information": "Adding Columns to Types Local attributes are attributes that can only store zero or one value for an attribute. The values of these attributes are stored in one or more modeled columns in the database table associated with the class. A class must be explicitly modeled to include these modeled columns in order for this feature to be available. For general information on creating new attributes through the Type and Attribute Management utility, see Creating A New Attribute . The following column data types are supported for local attributes: \u2022 String \u2022 Long \u2022 Double \u2022 Boolean \u2022 Timestamp \u2022 ObjectReference \u2022 VersionReference (applicable to PTC FlexPLM types only) \u2022 InlineBLOB (not applicable to PTC FlexPLM types) To create a local attribute on a type with a data type of Real Number or Real Number with Units, two columns must be added to the database table: one of data type Long, and one of data type Double. To create a local attribute on a type with a data type of Hyperlink, two String data type columns must be added to the database table. The AddColumns tool allows you to add columns to types for storing local attributes. This tool generates the *TypeInfo.java and *TypeInterface.java source files for the specified types. It then compiles those source files to generate the corresponding class files ( _*TypeInfo.class , _*TypeInterface.class , *TypeInfo.class ) and introspection files ( *TypeInfo.ClassInfo.ser , *TypeInterface.class , and *TypeInterface.ClassInfo.ser ). The tool also updates the database schema and the local attribute column schema file ( AddColumnsSchema.xml ) to reflect the new columns. The local attribute column schema file defines the complete local attribute column configuration for all types in the system. The local attribute column schema file ( AddColumnsSchema.xml ) must NEVER be manually edited, but only updated through use of the AddColumns tool. Was this helpful?

The report compares the database, the local attribute column schema file ( AddColumnsSchema.xml ), introspection files, and class files for the specified type and reports on the following: \u2022 Column counts for each column data type: \u25e6 The total column count for the data type. \u25e6 The reserved column count for the data type (the number of columns reserved for attributes provided out-of-the-box by PTC). \u25e6 The unallocated column count for the data type (the number of columns not yet in use). \u2022 Column order. \u2022 String data type column size. \u2022 The total column count in use for the type. This includes both the local attribute columns listed in the report, and all other columns on the type. \u2022 The number of columns that can still be added for the type, based on column data type, before the maximum allowed column count is reached. If there is a mismatch in any of this information between the database, local attribute column schema file, introspection files, and class files, and the wt.properties file (for String column sizes, only), the report warns of the inconsistent information, and details the information found in each source.

You may continue to add an additional 96 columns of String, Long, Double, Boolean or an additional 48 columns of InlineBLOB or an additional 30 columns of ObjectReference, VersionReference before the maximum allowed database columns is reached. The following is an example of the portion of the report when the total column counts for a data type are inconsistent: Total Long column count = 20 (Database) **WARNING Total Long column count = 20 (AddColumnsSchema.xml) **WARNING Total Long column count = 21 (Introspection) **WARNING Total Long column count = 21 (Class) **WARNING Reserved Long column count = 0 Unallocated Long column count = 11 If you have run the tool with the -a parameter without then running the command with the -u parameter, the report shows that the class and introspection files have larger column counts than the database and the AddColumnsSchema.xml file. \u2022 If you want to keep those additional columns, run the AddColumns tool with the -u parameter. \u2022 If you do not want to keep those additional columns, run the AddColumns tool with the -syncFromDB parameter. Once the database has been updated, either by running the AddColumns tool in plain mode, or running the AddColumns tool with the -u parameter, the database has been permanently updated. There is no supported method for removing columns once they have been added to the database. If the report warns of column order mismatches, run the AddColumns tool with the -syncFromDB parameter, then re-apply any changes that you were attempting to make.

Before running the AddColumns to add local attribute columns to a type, first run the AddColumns tool with the -r parameter to check for any warnings. Correct those warnings before proceeding to add local attribute columns to the type. The usage of the AddColumns tool is as follows: AddColumns [-a][-u][-r][-syncFromDB] type_name datatype=number {datatype=number} [directory] [-s][-f][-stringSize] AddColumns -u [-s] AddColumns -r type_name [directory] AddColumns -syncFromDB AddColumns [-a] type_name [datatype=number {datatype=number}] -stringSize The square brackets ( [ ] )indicate parameters that are optional, while the curly brackets ( { } ) indicate parameters that can be specified more than once. To see the usage details for the AddColumns tool, execute the AddColumns command from a Windchill shell with no additional parameters. The following table describes the input parameters and arguments that can be specified with the AddColumns tool: Parameter Description -a Adds additional columns only to the specified type class without upgrading the database schema. The type_name and datatype and number parameters must also be specified. Updates the introspection ( .ser ) and class files ( .class ) to include the new columns. The total number of ObjectReference and VersionReference columns on a type cannot exceed thirty-five (35). -u Upgrade the database schema and the local attribute column schema file. This parameter must be used after running the command with the -a parameter on multiple types, before starting or restarting the method server. Unless the -s parameter is specified at the same time as the -u parameter, the Upgrade Schema window of the Windchill Upgrade Tool is launched to display progress. The window disappears once the database schema upgrade completes. Upgrading the database schema (running the AddColumns tool with the -u parameter) can take a long time. As a result, the -u parameter is typically run only after running the AddColumns tool with the -a parameter multiple times. If you exceed the maximum number of ObjectReference and VersionReference columns on a type (35), or if the total number of columns on the type added exceeds the maximum allowed for your database, the database schema upgrade fails. -r Reports the column information for the specified type. For more information, see AddColumns Report and Addressing Warnings . -syncFromDB Updates the local attribute column schema file to match the database schema, and also updates the introspection ( .ser ) and class files ( .class ) to match the database schema for all types. type_name The fully qualified name of the modeled class to which to add the columns. This value is displayed in the Internal Name field for the type in the Type and Attribute Management utility. datatype The data type of column to add. The legal values are: String , Long , Double , Boolean , Timestamp , ObjectReference , VersionReference , and InlineBLOB . number The number of columns to add. directory The directory in which to store the generated type column Java files. This parameter is optional. Without this parameter, the generated Java files are stored in <Windchill> \\temp\\src . -s Run in silent mode, that is, the Upgrade Schema window of the Windchill Upgrade Tool is not launched. This parameter is valid only when specified with the -u or -syncFromDB parameters. -f Force columns to be added even if the total number of table columns will be greater than 255. Increasing the number of total columns above 255 can impact performance. You cannot add more columns than the maximum number allowed for your database. -stringSize Reconfigure the column size of String data type columns based on the value of the com.ptc.core.lwc.string.ColumnSizes property (valid range is 500-4000).

This value is displayed in the Internal Name field for the type in the Type and Attribute Management utility. For example, wt.part.WTPart or wt.doc.WTDocument . \u2022 <column_size> \u2014the desired data size for the column. This value must be between 500 and 4000. If the values specified are outside of this range, the tool defaults to 500 for the given modeled class. The value specified must be greater than the current value; a value less than the current value is ignored. \u2022 A colon ( : ) is used as the separator between the type and column size value pairs. Properties files such as wt.properties must never be manually edited. Use the xconfmanager command-line utility to add or modify properties. For more information, see the \u201cAbout the xconfmanager Utility\u201d topic in the Windchill Help Center . The following example allocates all String data type local attribute columns in the database as 1000 for parts and 2000 for documents: com.ptc.core.lwc.string.ColumnSizes=wt.part.WTPart=1000:wt.doc.WTDocument=2000 After setting the com.ptc.core.lwc.string.ColumnSizes property value for a particular type, when you next run the AddColumns tool with the -stringSize parameter to create additional columns on that type, all existing String data type attribute columns on the type are changed to the new column size. Once the size of the String data type columns for a type have been increased, there is no supported method for decreasing them. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

When exporting and importing type information, the system from which you are exporting and the system to which you are importing must be at the same release level.Load files exported from a previous release may not load or work as expected. Only previously exported type information should be imported. Manual editing of import load files is not supported. For your initial deployment, the recommended strategy is: 1. Configure and verify your types, attributes, attribute layouts, and global enumerations in a test environment. 2. Export the type information from the test environment. 3. Import the type information into your production environment. When changes are needed in your production environment, the recommended strategy is: 1. Export the type information from your production environment. 2. Import the type information into a test environment. 3.

The import action does the following: \u2022 For the type or global enumeration specified in the load file, any new information (types, attributes, constraints, cascading attributes, property values, global enumerations, and so on) in the load file is added to the system. \u2022 For the type or global enumeration specified in the load file, any information existing in the system that is also in the load file is updated based on the contents of the load file. \u2022 For the type specified in the load file, all attribute layout-related information on the type is completely deleted from the system and rebuilt based on the contents of the load file. \u2022 For the type specified in the load file, any information existing for the type in the target system, but that is not also in the load file, is deleted from the system. For example, if an attribute is present in both the system and the load file, any default value for the attribute in the system that is not also present in the load file is deleted. (Global enumerations are not deleted by this process.) For precautionary purposes, any subtypes and attributes existing in the target system, but not present in the load file, are not immediately deleted. Instead, delete load directives are created in secondary load files for each subtype and attribute that is in the system, but not in the load file. Each subtype with attributes that could be deleted will have a secondary load file created containing delete load directives for each of those attributes. Another secondary load file will be created containing delete load directives for all subtypes that could be deleted. These secondary load files, if any, are found in the following location after the import is complete: <Windchill> /temp/LWCTypeImpExp View the delete load directives in the secondary load files. If you want those deletions to be performed, rerun the LoadFromFile command, this time targeting the desired secondary load file. Was this helpful? This site works best with JavaScript enabled"

            "title": "Using the TypeAttributeMoveTool Utility for FlexPLM",
            "information": "Using the TypeAttributeMoveTool Utility for FlexPLM The TypeAttributeMoveTool command-line utility allows you to copy attribute values from one attribute to another attribute for a type and all its subtypes. The source and target attributes must be FlexPLM local attributes. This ability to copy values between attributes on a type can also be used to, rename an attribute or move an attribute within a type hierarchy, that is from a subtype to a type or from a type to a subtype. These special use cases are described in the later sections. Pre-requisites Before you run the utility, note the following: \u2022 The specified type, the source attribute, and the target attribute must exist in PTC FlexPLM . \u2022 Both attributes must be on the same type, and must have the same data type. \u2022 Any references to the original source attributes, such as in derived strings or numeric attributes, must be changed to refer to the target attributes. \u2022 When you run the tool, for all instances of the specified type. \u25e6 Current values of the target attribute are deleted. \u25e6 All values from the source attribute are copied to the target attribute. \u2022 During the execution of the utility, the immutable constraint is set on the source attribute to prevent new instances from being created or existing instances from being changed. \u2022 The immutable constraint type has been exposed in the PTC FlexPLM Type and Attribute Management user interface to satisfy the pre-requisites for the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility. The immutable constraint is not functional in the core PTC FlexPLM user interface or PTC FlexPLM server. Therefore, site administrators must not use it. \u2022 All local attributes except Object Reference and Version Reference are supported by the utility. Existing values on the target attribute are permanently deleted. Local attributes are stored in columns on the underlying object class. If there are no columns available on the class for new local attributes, an error message appears when you attempt to create a new local attribute. By default, there are no additional columns on any object class for local attributes. For information on adding columns for local attributes, see \u201cAdding Columns to Types\u201d. Copying Attribute Values To copy attribute values, type: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool <typeName> <sourceAttributeName> <targetAttributeName> -u <userID> -p <password> where: \u2022 <typeName> is the internal name of the type. \u2022 <sourceAttributeName> is the internal name of the source attribute. \u2022 <targetAttributeName> is the internal name of the target attribute. \u2022 <userID> is the user name of the site administrator user. \u2022 <password> is the password of the site administrator user. After executing the utility, delete the original source attribute from the system using the Type and Attribute Management utility. This deletes all existing instances of the source attribute and their values. Renaming an Attribute While the internal name of an attribute cannot be changed, you can use the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility to achieve the same result by moving the values from one attribute to another attribute that has the desired internal name. For example, if you have an attribute named \u201cABC\u201d which you want to change to \u201cXYZ\u201d, perform the following steps: 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, create an attribute named \u201cXYZ\u201d on the same type as, and with the same data type as, the attribute named \u201cABC\u201d. 2. In a Windchill shell, execute the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool <typeName> \"ABC\" \"XYZ\" -u <userID> -p <password> This copies all the attribute value instances from the attribute named \u201cABC\u201d to the attribute named \u201cXYZ\u201d. 3. After you have confirmed that everything is in order with the instance values for the attribute named \u201cXYZ\u201d, you can delete the attribute named \u201cABC\u201d. Moving an Attribute from a Subtype to a Type, or a Type to a Subtype While attributes cannot be moved from one type to another. You can use the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility to achieve this result within a type hierarchy, by moving values of an attribute created on a subtype to an attribute inherited from the parent or other ancestor type, or by moving values from an attribute inherited from the parent or other ancestor type to an attribute created on a subtype. To move an attribute definition higher in the type hierarchy, from a subtype to a parent or other ancestor type, perform the following steps: 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, create a new attribute on the parent or other ancestor type, that has the same data type as the attribute on the subtype. The subtype now inherits this new attribute from the type. 2. Use the TypeAttributeMoveTool to move the values from the attribute on the subtype to the attribute inherited from the type, as described in the \u201cRenaming an Attribute\u201d section. 3. Confirm that the results are as expected. 4. Delete the attribute from the child type. To move an attribute definition lower in the type hierarchy, from a parent or other ancestor type to a subtype, perform the following steps: 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, create a new attribute on the subtype, that has the same data type as the attribute on the parent or other ancestor type. The child type now has the newly-created attribute as well as the attribute already inherited from the parent or other ancestor type. 2. Use the TypeAttributeMoveTool to move the values from the attribute inherited from the parent or other ancestor type to the newly created attribute on the subtype, as described in the \u201cRenaming an Attribute\u201d section. 3. Confirm that the results are as expected. 4. Delete the attribute from the type. The internal name of an attribute must be unique among all subtypes and types of a type. If you want to use the internal name of the attribute on the original type as the internal name of the attribute on the target type to which the attribute is being moved, first create a temporary attribute on the target type. Then move the attribute values to the temporary attribute on the target type, using the above steps. After you delete the original attribute, you can create a new attribute that has the desired internal name on the target type, and move the attribute instance values from the temporary attribute to the newly-created attribute, as described in the \u201cRenaming an Attribute\u201d section. For more information, see the following detailed examples: \u2022 Moving a Local Attribute Lower in the Type Hierarchy. \u2022 Moving a Local Attribute Higher in the Type Hierarchy. \u2022 Moving Other Types of Attributes Lower or Higher in a Type Hierarchy. All types and attributes in the examples have the same values for their internal names and their display names. Moving a Local Attribute Lower in the Type Hierarchy Nigel\u2019s company has created a subtype of the product type named MyProduct , which in turn has a subtype named MySubProduct . Currently, there is a local attribute named Country defined on the MyProduct subtype, which is inherited by the MySubProduct type. There are values for the Country attribute on MyProduct and MySubProduct . However, the company has decided that only Country needs to be specified on the MySubProduct type. As a result, Nigel wants to move the Country attribute definition from the MyProduct subtype down the type hierarchy to the MySubProduct subtype, so that the Country attribute is defined on the MySubProduct subtype, and only the values already defined for the Country attribute on MySubProduct are retained. If there are other subtypes of the MyProduct type that are peers rather than children of the MySubProduct subtype, any values specified for the original Country attribute defined on and inherited from the MyProduct type are deleted when the original Country attribute is deleted at the end of this process. This is accomplished by performing the following steps: 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel carefully notes the details of the Country attribute defined on the MyProduct subtype, including the data type. 2. Nigel creates a new local attribute on the MyProduct subtype, named CountryCopy , which is identical to the original Country attribute. The CountryCopy attribute is now also inherited by the MySubProduct subtype. 3. In a Windchill shell, Nigel executes the following command to copy the values of the Country attribute to the CountryCopy attribute on the MyProduct subtype: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool MyProduct Country CountryCopy When prompted, Nigel enters his administrative user name and password. As the MySubProduct subtype inherits the Country attribute from the MyProduct subtype, all values of the country attribute on the MySubProduct subtype are also copied to the inherited CountryCopy attribute. 4. Back in the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel deletes the Country attribute from the MyProduct subtype. All instances of that attribute, including the attribute values, are deleted as well. 5. Nigel now creates a new local attribute on the MySubProduct subtype named Country , which is identical to the original Country attribute. 6. In a Windchill shell, Nigel executes the following command to copy the values of the inherited CountryCopy attribute to the Country attribute now defined on the MySubProduct subtype: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool MySubProduct CountryCopy Country When prompted, Nigel enters his administrative user name and password. 7. Back in the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel deletes the CountryCopy attribute from the MyProduct subtype. Moving a Local Attribute Higher in the Type Hierarchy There is a local attribute named Size on the MySubProduct subtype that Nigel wants to move up the type hierarchy to the MyProduct subtype so that the attribute is inherited by the MySubProduct subtype and all other subtypes of MyProduct . There are values for the Size attribute on the MySubProduct subtype, and Nigel wants to keep these values intact, after the Size attribute is moved up to the MyProduct subtype. This is accomplished by completing the following steps: 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel carefully notes the details of the Size attribute defined on the MySubProduct subtype, including the data type. 2. Nigel creates a new local attribute on the MyProduct subtype, named SizeCopy , which is identical to the original Size attribute on the MySubProduct subtype. The SizeCopy attribute is now inherited by the MySubProduct subtype. 3. In a Windchill shell, Nigel executes the following command to copy the values of the Size attribute to the inherited SizeCopy attribute on the MySubProduct subtype: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool MySubProduct Size SizeCopy When prompted, Nigel enters his administrative user name and password. 4. Back in the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel deletes the Size attribute from the MySubProduct subtype. 5. Nigel now creates a new local attribute on the MyProduct subtype named Size , which is identical to the original Size attribute. The MySubProduct subtype now inherits the Size attribute from the MyProduct subtype. 6. In a Windchill shell, Nigel executes the following command to copy the values of the inherited SizeCopy attribute to the new Size attribute on the MyProduct subtype: windchill com.ptc.core.lwc.server.TypeAttributeMoveTool MyProduct SizeCopy Size When prompted, Nigel enters his administrative user name and password. 7. Back in the Type and Attribute Management utility, Nigel deletes the SizeCopy attribute from the MyProduct subtype. Moving Other Types of Attributes Lower or Higher in a Type Hierarchy The TypeAttributeMoveTool utility does not support alias attributes and calculated attributes. However, FlexPLM calculated attributes can be moved from one level to another within a type hierarchy by direct manipulation in the Type and Attribute Management utility. To move calculated attribute higher or lower within a type hierarchy, perform the following steps: 1. Record how the calculated attribute is currently defined. 2. Delete the attribute. 3. Re-create the attribute on the desired type within the type hierarchy. \u2022 The above steps are not supported for FlexPLM alias attributes. \u2022 To perform above operations on attributes belonging to synchronized types, the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility must be run twice, that is, once for primary type attributes and once for secondary type attributes. While running TypeAttributeMoveTool utility on FlexPLM types that have trigger-managed performance tables, follow the steps given below for improved performance while running the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility. FlexPLM type with Trigger-managed performance table: Type Modeled Table Trigger Managed Table Product LCSProduct prodarev Product Cost Sheet LCSProductCostsheet productcostsheet Product Season Link LCSProductSeasonLink productseasonlink SKU LCSSKU skuarev Colorway Cost Sheet LCSSKUCostsheet skucostsheet Colorway Season Link LCSSKUSeasonLink skuseasonlink Source to Season Link LCSSourceToSeasonLink lcssourcetoseasonlink_eff Sourcing Configuration LCSSourcingConfig lcssourcingconfig_eff WorkItem LCSWorkItem lcsworkitem 1. Perform the appropriate database level backup to restore the database if something unexpected happens. 2. Drop or disable the triggers defined in the system. a. sql*\\com\\lcs\\triggers\\drop_triggers.sql b. commit; 3. Execute the TypeAttributeMoveTool utility. As the triggers are intentionally removed, the data in tables that are managed by the triggers will be out-of-sync with their equivalent modeled tables. However, it will be resynchronized by the steps below. 4. Drop or recreate or repopulate the trigger managed tables to resynchronize them with their equivalent modeled tables. a. db\\sql*\\com\\lcs\\views\\create_linesheet_tableviews.sql b. commit; c. db\\sql*\\com\\lcs\\views\\create_workitem_tableviews.sql d. commit; 5.

If customers have generated one or more database view definitions, and they have used the view definition as it was originally generated with no customization to the VIEW definition DDL, they must regenerate all type-level database views using the DBViewGeneratorHelper command-line utility. For more information, see \"Creating Database Views\" in the Windchill Help Center . If customers have customized the view definition created by the utility in an earlier release of PTC FlexPLM , they must apply equivalent customizations to the newly generated type-level view definition. This action must be done in addition to regenerating the database view definition using the DBViewGeneratorHelper command-line utility. Customers cannot rely on previously captured type-level database view definitions if the view was created using the Create Database View action. Customers must instead regenerate the type-level database view definition. Numerous changes in the database schema and attribute definitions resulting from convergence on the Windchill Type and Attribute Management utility require new view definitions to be generated.

This document contains information and guidelines on how to customize if it\u2019s necessary. Customizations should be avoided if possible as they are potentially impactful and costly during the testing, patching, and upgrading processes. The following list highlights the technical changes applied to some product pages as the user experience and user interface is enhanced starting in the 12.0 release. The list is meant to highlight areas of the application which if previously customized may require attention during the migration to the 12.0 release. \u2022 Use of frameset is removed in the shell of the application, replaced by iframes. Interoperability between frames is consistent with prior releases. \u2022 Organization or Location of JSP pages in the codebase: \u25e6 When merging JSP override customizations be sure to validate the path to the new user interface page in urlMappings.properties . Some out of the box files now reside in a \"v2\" subfolder structure <codebase>\\rfa\\jsp\\v2\\<package>\\<jsp files> whose contents follow a similar structure to <codebase>\\rfa\\jsp\\<package>\\<jsp files> . The urlMappings.properties identify the files in the v2 folder structure that are the out-of-the-box files. Legacy pages ONLY remain in the original folders for the purpose of easily comparing the prior content to your customized pages for the prior release when determining if or how to merge your custom code forward to the new release. Obsolete JSP and JSP fragment files will be removed in a future release. \u2022 Form generation via Flextype generator and form generator now supports new attribute widget renderers and new form element renderers to provide consistent element generation in redesigned pages. Redesigned pages make use of the classes FlexTypeGenerator2 , FormGenerator2 and their methods and the new attribute and form element renderer classes via dependency injection, while legacy pages continue to use the prior FormGenerator class methods. \u25e6 New attribute renderers used in the generation of redesigned pages use HTML Div-based Card and CSS grid layouts to provide responsive attribute panels with consistent theming. \u25e6 Attribute presentation order within attribute panels is controlled by the order that attributes are assigned as members to the layout components of the PTC FlexPLM retail layout in the Type and Attribute Management utility. \u25aa Attribute order is determined by reading the attributes left-to-right, and top-to-bottom \u25aa Attribute panel layout is no longer limited to 2 columns. Instead layout gets flexible and responsive based on the size of the browser window where standard display resolution of 1900x1280 results in a 6-column layout in each attribute panel. \u25e6 Attribute renderers for common list-based attributes such as single list, multi list, user list, color choice, driven, object reference list, care wash instructions are enhanced to support inline search and common display behaviors for single select and multi select actions. \u25aa The enhanced attribute widgets rely on an external javascript library (select2) that converts the generated hidden HTML Select elements into dropdown widgets with enhanced behaviors. \u25aa Accessing of the hidden HTML Select elements for these attribute types within client-side plug-ins is no different than accessing the non-hidden HTML Select elements in prior releases. \u25aa Writing Client Side Plug-in (CSP) customizations should remain similar to prior releases (acquiring a page key, looking up elements of an attributes widget with getKeyElement(<internal attribute name>) , etc.) with one exception, accessing the multi list attribute widget is different From PTC FlexPLM 12.0.0.0 release onwards behavior of multi-list widget has changed, prior to the 12.0 FlexPLM release the widget for a multi list attribute was a complex widget having two HTML Select elements named as att###Options and att###Chosen . The options element held all possible options available for selection and the chosen element held the currently selected options for a multi list attribute. In 12.0, the redesigned multi-list widget has only the att###Options element, therefore to interact with a multi-list attributes widget in a client-side plug-in, the options element must be retrieved using the client side plug-in helper. For example, the Client Side Plug-in must include a line as follows: var multiListWidget = document.MAINFORM.<%= csph.getKeyElement(\"<internal attribute name>\") + \"Options\" %>; and the CSP code would generate: var multiListWidget = document.MAINFORM.att###Options; \u25aa As always use of the ClientSidePluginHelper getKeyElement method requires the internal attribute name to ensure that the dynamically generated form element name is considered when using the CSP customization on multiple systems (dev, test, or prod). \u2022 Table generation is updated to apply new styles to auto generated tables in the application. \u25e6 Redesigned pages containing tables generated by the TableGenerator class support sticky column headers. \u2022 CSS classes applied to elements of redesigned pages can be found in the file. \u25e6 codebase\\rfa\\css\\default\\main.css Was this helpful?

            "information": "Custom Access Validators You can use a custom access validator to add permission checks to a given object class. For example, you might need access to another business object before you can create a given object. Because this kind of access control cannot easily be performed with the Policy Administration utility, you can create a custom validator to perform this check. A custom validator can also be created to override an out-of-the-box validator, which can remove additional out-of-the-box access checks. For example, this can be useful for vendor portal functionality where out-of-the-box access is restricted for all vendors, but a customer wants to relax the rules for specific vendors. Custom access validators do not remove or bypass rules that are configured in the Policy Administration utility. These validators are only used to add or remove access control based on business rules. To provide custom access control validators for PTC FlexPLM objects, you must do the following: 1. Create a java class validator. 2. Register the validator. Creating a Validator Create a java class that extends the DefaultACLValidator Flex class. By providing your own access validator, you replace any out-of-the-box validators. For example, the existing LCSMeasurementsACLValidator Flex class has logic to prevent deletion of an LCSPointsOfMeasure object if its type is \u201cLIBRARY\u201d and the user is not in the measurements administrator group. If you want to include the existing Flex validation, extend the existing validator instead of DefaultACLValidator and use the super call where necessary. There are seven methods that you can override to provide your own logic: \u2022 Four methods corresponding to an access type: \u25e6 hasViewAccess(WTObject) \u25e6 hasCreateAccess(WTObject) \u25e6 hasModifyAccess(WTObject) \u25e6 hasDeleteAccess(WTObject) Before these methods are called, the system determines if the user has access permissions as defined in the Policy Administration utility. The user must have access to the type of object being checked. To be granted create, modify, and delete access, the user must have view access. These checks are not part of the out-of-the-box access validator, and they cannot be overridden. \u2022 A method that determines access for a passed access type: hasAccess(WTObject, AccessPermission) \u2022 Two methods used by the ClientModels to determine if the user has administrative access: \u25e6 hasAdminAccess() \u25e6 hasAdminAccess(String adminGroupName) Registering a Validator To register the validator, add a property to custom.lcs.properties using the following format: ACLValidatorFactory.validatorOveride. <FlexClassName> = <ValidatorClassName> The following is an example for the LCSColor property: ACLValidatorFactory.validatorOveride.com.lcs.wc.color.LCSColor=com.myco.LCSColorValidator Was this helpful?

The OpenTypes.DOCUMENT property allows the vendor to view and update different document types. The actions (view, create, edit) that can be performed on the available objects are controlled through the Policy Administration utility. Once the OpenTypes.DOCUMENT property is configured, vendors can view different levels of the type tree under the document type, but do not have access to subtypes or any other document type unless access has been specifically granted. Because it is possible to give a vendor create access to a document type that they do not have view or edit permissions for, and do not see in search results, you must carefully review document access controls and the settings related to vendors in the Policy Administration utility. VendorPortal.properties File Refer to the out-of-the-box VendorPortal.properties file for further description of these settings. Each document type and vendor group is separated by a pipe |, allowing multiple vendor groups to be on the same line. It is also possible to add a sequence number.

The use cases supported include the following: \u2022 Generic documents that should be accessible to all users. For example, Reference documents or Training Documents \u2022 Documents created and managed by Vendor, accessible to internal users and Vendor \u2022 Documents that are context specific and shared within the context, between Vendor and internal users or between internal users and all users with access to the product. For example, documents associated to the specification \u2022 Documents that are shared internally and not any Vendor portal user. To support these use cases various capabilities are enabled in PTC FlexPLM that can be further configured or controlled through settings. The basic use cases that are supported are as follows: 1. Vendors create documents\u2014Provided appropriate document type level access, Vendors can create new documents. 2. Vendor search documents\u2014Given appropriate type level access, Vendors can search for documents where the logged in user is set as the creator or for all documents belonging to types designated as Open Types For more information, see Document Security . 3. Vendors update documents\u2014Provided appropriate document type level access, Vendors can update documents that were created by the logged in user. Additionally, a Vendor User can also update other documents shared with them based on type permissions and context. 4. Vendors view documents in the appropriate search context\u2014Vendor access to documents in the Document library using search functionality whether in the Document Library search, Header search, Version Reference attributes chooser search, Document References or Described By references. Search limits access to document instances based on the following: \u25e6 Type level policy access controls user access to the document. \u25e6 Creator\u2014The Vendor user created the document \u25e6 Open Types\u2014The Document type is configured as OpenTypes.DOCUMENT property for the Vendor. Certain Document Types in the Document Type hierarchy can be configured to be designated as an Open Type. For such types, only Type Manager access is used to validate user access and no additional Vendor Portal access rules (contextual or non-contextual) apply to regulate access. This is subject to change in a future release. 5. Vendors view documents in other contexts\u2014There are several scenarios where Vendors can review documents either by searching or navigating to them based on the relevant context such as Product or Material or others where the logged in Vendor is associated as a Source or Supplier. These scenarios include: \u25e6 Documents associated with a Specification, where logged in Vendor is the Source. \u25e6 Documents associated with a Material Supplier or Material Color, where logged in Vendor is the Supplier. \u25e6 Documents associated with a Sample, where logged in Vendor is the Source. \u25e6 Documents associated to an RFQ Request or Order Confirmation, where logged in Vendor is the Source. \u25e6 Documents associated to a Vendor (Supplier) associated with which the logged in Vendor user is associated.

Groups Access to the vendor portal is controlled through user groups. The Vendors user group allows its subgroups to access the vendor portal. Each group within the Vendors group represents a vendor company or a division within a company. Users within any subgroup of the Vendors group are considered vendors, and can access only the vendor portal. To access PTC FlexPLM , the Vendors group must be part of the Retail group. 1. Create a group called Vendors . This is the main group for determining vendors within the system. All users in this group or its subgroups are deemed vendors, regardless of any other group they belong to outside of the Vendors group. a.

            "title": "Linked Objects",
            "information": "Linked Objects Depending on the use case, you can allow control to various objects by linking the object to one of the vendor objects. The primary link for most of the use cases is the sourcing configuration. Through this link, access to product, colorway, costing, samples, and other details, is enabled, based on type permissions. By way of the supplier object, both the material and material supplier objects are also available. You may want to consider linking for Sourcing Configuration that represents the following scenarios as examples: \u2022 A Supplier, Agent and Factory or any combination of these. \u2022 A Material-Supplier instance that must be accessible not only to the raw material\u2019s supplier but also to all Finished-Goods Vendors who need access to the Material library. However, they are not raw material suppliers or are raw material suppliers to all the materials in the library. \u2022 A Product Sample that is to be accessed by a Factory or an entity that is not the source. Using the configurations described below, you can grant access to these additional Vendor (Supplier) entities for instances that they would otherwise be unable to access. Creating the Links You can create the sourcing configuration link using the Type and Attribute Management utility and the VendorPortal.properties file. This process is similar to configuring vendor objects. Sourcing Configuration Using Sourcing Configuration you can enable access to Product and its related entities such as Specification, Samples and more. You define an attribute in VendorPortal.properties for each use case that links to the sourcing configuration. RFQ.RFQCriteriaAttribute= <CriteriaAttribute> SAMPLE.SampleCriteriaAttribute= <CriteriaAttribute> The value for the <CriteriaAttribute> for the two properties must be the internal name of an reference attribute on the sourcing configuration root type. The attributes must be a reference, and must point to a supplier type. By default, the value is set to <vendor> for both entries in the VendorPortal.properties file. Using the additional criteria setting more limiting criteria to control access can be specified. The value for the <CriteriaAttribute> must correlate to an internal name on the sourcing configuration root type. The attributes must be an object reference, and must point to one of the three vendor objects: agent, factory, or supplier. You can use the same value for both property settings, if the same criteria is applicable to both the RFQ and sample use cases. By default, the value is set to <vendor> for both use cases in the VendorPortal.properties file. The minimum configuration out of the box is to add an object reference attribute to the sourcing configuration root type. The attribute refers to either an agent or a factory. The custom.VendorPortal.properties file must be updated to override or activate settings within this file. These two property settings can also use comma separated values to support multiple vendors. For example: Consider the case where the Sample is to be accessible to the Supplier, Agent and Factory. To grant access, you must complete the following configuration. You may replace the name and values that are referenced below. 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, add three Version Reference attributes to the Sourcing Configuration root type, that point to the Supplier root type, to the Agent sub-type and Factory sub-type to describe the Supplier, Agent and Factory respectively. Define the internal names as \u201crefSupplier\u201d, \u201crefAgent\u201d, and \u201crefFactory\u201d respectively. 2. Update the VendorPortal properties (custom.vendorPortal.properties file) to reflect the following: SAMPLE.SampleCriteriaAttribute=refSupplier,refAgent,refFactory With this, a Sample is created for a Product and a Specification. Sourcing Configuration is accessible (subject to additional criteria and policy admin ACL settings) to the Supplier, Agent, and Factory associated with the Sourcing Configuration. Material The supplier relationship is inherent to the material data model. Therefore, no additional configuration is required. If the Material use case is enabled for access via Vendor Portal, Suppliers of the material (users associated with the user group defined on the Supplier) are able to access the Material and the Material-Supplier instance subject to policy admin access control rules. You do not need any additional configuration to link materials to a supplier. Additional Criteria Without additional criteria, the material and material-supplier are accessible only to internal users and the specific supplier of the material. However, other vendors who are not suppliers of materials need access to the material library to suggest relevant alternatives or complete the build-out of the BOM. Access to Material-Supplier instances can be granted via the additional criteria setting described here. The property list below takes multiple values separated by a comma(,). As in the case of the sourcing configuration, the value of the above property should be the internal name of a reference attribute on the Material-Supplier. For example: Consider the case where all Finished Goods Vendors are to be granted access to the entire material library. To do so, complete the following configuration. You may replace the name and values that are referenced below. 1. In the Type and Attribute Management utility, add a Version Reference attribute (pointing to the Supplier root type) to the root-type of Material-Supplier node with an internal name \u201cfinishedGoodsVendor\u201d 2. Create a user group called \u201cAll Finished-Goods Vendors User Group\u201d and add all user groups of finished goods suppliers as members of this user group. 3. Create a Supplier instance (of a relevant type) and name it \u201cAll Finished Goods Vendor\u201d. Associate the user group that you created in step 2 with the supplier instance as the value of a text attribute defined by the property ( SUPPLIER.supplierVendorAttribute ) for identifying the user group granting 4. Set the additional criteria property for the Material Supplier to be the internal key of the attribute that is defined in step 1. For example: MATERIALSUPPLIER.MaterialSupplierCriteriaAttribute=finishedGoodsVendor 5. On any Material-Supplier instance that all finished goods vendors need to access, set the value of the reference attribute that is defined in step 1 for the Material-Supplier to the \u201cAll Finished Goods Vendor\u201d instance defined in step 3. After you complete the above configuration, the Material-Supplier instance in step 5 is now accessible to all users who are members of the user group. Was this helpful?

For example: If you are not an internal user and you need access to PTC FlexPLM , it is recommended that you use Vendor Portal settings to obtain the required access. 1. Define a user group called \u201cVENDORS\u201d to identify all users of the Vendor Portal. 2. Set the value of the property -- com.lcs.wc.vendor.vendorGroup , in the vendor portal settings. 3.

The following rules are applicable to the RFQ and samples use cases: \u2022 The VendorPortal.properties file controls which attribute on the sourcing configuration object links to a vendor object. \u2022 The property setting internal name must match the internal name in the Type and Attribute Management utility. \u2022 The attribute must be either an object reference or an object reference list. \u2022 The object reference attribute must link to a vendor object, either agent, factory, or supplier. \u2022 The vendor object controls which user groups have access to the sourcing configuration object and its related objects. Quotes The quotes (or RFQ) use case exposes costing information to the vendor. This allows a vendor to view a restricted view of the line sheet, as well as all objects associated to a product/colorway, given the appropriate permissions in the Type and Attribute Management utility. A vendor must be set as the vendor for a given product or set of products in order to be given access to items in a line sheet. You do this by setting the vendor attribute on the sourcing configuration. If any additional criteria is configured in the VendorPortal.properties file, then this criteria must also be met in order for the vendor to see anything. Multiple vendors can be assigned to an RFQ. By default, all active vendors are selected. You can test this use case by performing the following steps: 1. As a non-vendor, set up test data that a vendor should be able to see. 2. Log into the system as the vendor. 3. On the side navigation bar, click Quotes . The page displays a Quotes page, with a Quote Counts table. This table displays each season that contains objects the vendor has access to, including counts for the number of products and colorways in each season that the vendor can view. Click a season name. This brings you to the Line Sheet for that season. The line sheet functions in the same manner as it does for a non-vendor, with the following exceptions: \u2022 There are fewer actions available from the main Actions menu. \u2022 Only those items that are linked to the vendor appear in the line sheet. In addition, the total number of products and colorways displayed in the Quote Counts table match the number of rows in the line sheet table. Clicking the name of a given product or colorway brings up the Product Details page, with the following exceptions: \u2022 There are fewer actions available from the main Actions menu. \u2022 The vendor cannot change the source unless the vendor has access to multiple sources for the product. Any other functionality remains consistent with that of nonvendor users. Only those objects and attributes permitted through the Type and Attribute Management utility are visible or editable. Samples The samples use case allows vendors to directly access the fit samples that are assigned to them. A fit sample is designated to a given vendor through the sourcing configuration. Like the RFQ use case, the vendor must be associated to a sourcing configuration. Additionally, a fit sample must be created for a measurements object that is associated to the same sourcing configuration. Any additional criteria defined in the VendorPortal.properties file must be met on both the sourcing configuration and sample objects as well. You can test this use case by performing the following steps: 1. As a non-vendor, set up test data that a vendor should be able to see. 2. Log into the system as the vendor. 3. On the side navigation bar, click Sample . The system displays the Fit Samples table. This table displays all fit samples to which the vendor has access. The table contains the following: \u2022 An update icon for each sample. \u2022 The name of the sample. Clicking the sample name takes you to the View Sample Request page for that sample. \u2022 The name of the product or style for which the sample is requested. Clicking the product or style name takes you to the Product Details page for that product or style. \u2022 The name of the source to which the sample is associated. Clicking the name of the sourcing configuration takes you to the Product Details for the requesting product. \u2022 The name of the measurements set for which the sample is requested. Clicking the name of the measurement set takes you to the Approvals Summary page for the requesting product. \u2022 The name of the season to which the product and source are associated. Clicking the name of the season takes you to the season line sheet. The same rules outlined in the \u201cQuotes\u201d section hold true when accessing the line sheet from the Fit Samples table The links in the Fit Samples table, and any links available on subsequent pages, follow permissions in the Type and Attribute Management utility.

If Agent X were to log in at this point, they would be able to see both the home page and their worklist, which would be empty. Access to other objects in the system is granted using vendor objects. These objects represent certain roles that a vendor can fill: \u2022 Agent \u2022 Factory \u2022 Supplier A vendor user is bound to use one or more of these objects. These vendor objects are in turn bound to other objects throughout the system. This binding allows vendor users to access additional objects within the system. Vendor Object Setup The VendorPortal.properties file controls which attributes maintain the vendor object link. Entries in the VendorPortal.properties file must match the internal name and be text attributes. When viewing the vendor object Update page, the system automatically enters the name of a vendor\u2019s group subgroup as the attribute value. This allows users of the subgroup to access the vendor object. Vendor Object Configuration There are two requirements for configuration of vendor objects: \u2022 VendorPortal.properties file The VendorPortal.properties file is located in your codebase directory. This file potentially contains many entries. The default file supplies examples of how to configure the entries in the file. The VendorPortal.properties file is included only as a template for possible settings for the custom.VendorPortal.properties file. This file is located in the same folder as the VendorPortal.properties file, and works in the same manner as other custom property files. It overrides content in the main file. The property setting to use when configuring vendor objects is: SUPPLIER.supplierVendorAttribute= vendor This entry exists by default, and dictates which attribute binds the vendor users to the given vendor object. As with all property settings, the value for this property setting is the internal name. The display value for these attributes is not a factor. The default value for this property setting is vendor . You can configure this value to be an internal name of your choosing. It is not required that the value be vendor for the property setting to function. However, for the remainder of these topics, it is assumed that the value of the property setting is vendor . If you do not intend to change the property setting value, you are not required to do anything further in the properties file at this time. \u2022 Configuration in the Type and Attribute Management utility You must update the Agent , Factory , and Supplier subtypes on the Vendor (Supplier) type to add the vendor-specific attribute. The system currently expects a text attribute and enters a group name as the attribute value. Any additional vendor object information, such as contact information, that you want a vendor to be able to change must be associated to a separate attribute group, and group permissions adjusted accordingly. The vendor must not be able to change attributes such as the name or vendor, because this would result in the vendor\u2019s ability to change who has access to objects within the system.

Earlier and current releases of PTC FlexPLM that do not have version control enabled only allow for a single type of document association, where the latest iteration of a document is associated to the selected object. These documents are called Reference documents. When version control is enabled, you are also able to select a specific version of a document to associate to the object. This association creates a Described By document, and the link always refers to the latest revision of the specific document version. It is possible to associate more than one version and revision of a document to an object using this method. When viewing the Associated Documents table for an object, Reference documents and Described By documents appear in separate lists. The version and iteration values for the documents are also shown. Associating as a Reference Document Creating an associated document as a Reference document does the following: \u2022 Document information always links to the most recent version and iteration. \u2022 Only a single copy of the document can be associated. Associating as a Described By Document Creating an associated document as a Described By document does the following: \u2022 Document information always links to the document version specified during the association. \u2022 Different versions of the same document can be associated as a Described By document.

Copying Objects when Shallow Copy is Enabled When an object is copied with a shallow copy system configuration, the new copy references the document with the same relationship as the original. For example, if the original product has two Reference document associations, and one Described By document association, links are copied to those documents in the same way. Copying Objects when Deep Copy is Enabled When an object is copied with a deep copy system configuration, the system creates new versions of the source documents, and associates them in the same way as the original object associations. For example, you have product M341 with a reference document at version C, and want to copy that product to create a new product with a deep copy system configuration. The system copies the product, and create a new reference document with a version value of A. For Reference document, deep copy uses the content from the latest version iteration. For Described By documents, the system uses the content from the specified version when creating the copy. Enabling Deep Copy Properties To enable deep copy functionality, set these property settings to true : com.lcs.wc.document.SKUDocs.deepCopy com.lcs.wc.document.productDocs.deepCopy Copying and Pasting Documents When versioned documents are copied to the clipboard, they retain the association and version detail and that is visible in the clipboard.

A rules load file sets the initial version control rules for documents and revisable entities. These rules are in effect for documents and revisable entities created from within any context. By default, version control is not enabled, and requires an administrator to change the property setting. When version control support is enabled, documents and revisable entities appear with version information throughout the system PTC recommends that you establish one version control scheme for all of your contexts and that you set the version control scheme in the site context. The out-of-the-box version control scheme is used to set the initial version of the document templates that are loaded during installation. Therefore, you should not change this scheme, as changes to the scheme can lead to data corruption if revision labels are not unique. Out-of-the-Box Version Control Scheme PTC FlexPLM follows the out-of-the-box version control scheme for Windchill PDMLink . The default version control scheme for all objects is set in the site context and is a simple alphabetical scheme. Version identifiers are first assigned as a single letter. After all letters from A through Z have been assigned, the following series are used: \u2022 AA\u2013ZZ \u25e6 AA, AB, AC, ..., AZ \u25e6 BA, BB, BC, ..., BZ \u25e6 (and so on) \u2022 AAA\u2013ZZZ \u25e6 AAB, AAC, ..., AAZ \u25e6 BAA, BAB, BAC, ..., BAZ \u25e6 (and so on) When a new view version of a part is created, the version in the new view starts a new version control scheme and the new view version inherits its content from the original revision in the ancestor view. In subsequent revisions of the new view version, the new version control scheme is followed and inheritance, or the predecessor for the version, is dependent on how the version was created.

            "title": "About FlexPLM 3D Collaboration",
            "information": "About FlexPLM 3D Collaboration One of the biggest challenges with 3D content is to make it accessible such as small files, light resource footprint with quality and interactive content. FlexPLM\u2019s 3D collaboration capabilities aims to make 3D accessible for all PLM Users making optimized 3D content readily available alongside other PLM data, so all Product data is consistently managed and presented in context while applying consistent business rules. The functionality in this initial release requires the use of 3D plug-ins for Browzwear or CLO with PTC FlexPLM . PTC FlexPLM 3D collaboration provides the following features that enable wider 3D content usage: \u2022 Large rendered 3D files. \u2022 A viewer that reviews the visual information with other data critical to the description of the product. \u2022 Quick loading of 3D files in the browser by reducing the viewable size of the content by more than 90 percent. \u2022 Collaborative presentation of the 3D visuals with other product data, that allows 3D users to review and explain the content internally and with vendors. You can directly acquire 3D content from the 3D tools using the 3D Plug-in integrations that PTC FlexPLM has to Browzwear and CLO. After saving the acquired content to PTC FlexPLM , the content is asynchronously shared with a cloud service to optimize it in the GLB or Browzwear format. You can then review the optimized content in the browser with an embedded viewer that also supports annotations and collaboration with internal and external users. To support 3D collaboration, the following data model updates and application updates are available: \u2022 A new branch-type, visual asset, that is the parent of all visual contents stored in PTC FlexPLM . \u2022 A new type, 3D view, which is a sub-type of document and visual asset and represents 3D viewable content in the GLB format. \u2022 An internal type to manage annotations and user comments about those annotations. \u2022 Services that interface with the 3D content optimization service in the cloud to share, optimize, and download the optimized content. \u2022 Services that purge 3D content from the optimization service after optimization is complete. \u2022 Audit log functionality that traces content handling. \u2022 One context to review all the visual assets of a product: 2D (product and colorway image pages) and 3D (optimized 3D content). \u2022 Integrated 3D viewer that maximizes the viewing area and allows mouse actions such as zoom, pan, and rotate. \u2022 3D collaboration capabilities in the viewer, that enable you to annotate specific locations on the 3D rendering with notes and respond or resolve those notes. \u2022 3D collaboration capabilities that include relevant business rules for vendors, limiting access to specific entries only. The above capabilities are available in the product visual assets context and the samples context to facilitate effective feedback. The 3D plug-ins with the ability to bring PTC FlexPLM to Browzwear and CLO, and 3D collaboration capabilities in PTC FlexPLM ensure that the benefits of 3D visuals are now accessible to all PTC FlexPLM users, enhancing the quality of the visual inputs to their decisions. Prerequisites To enable the 3D collaboration capabilities the following criteria must be fulfilled: \u2022 Your account representative or PTC Cloud service manager must add this optional service to your subscription. \u2022 In PTC FlexPLM 12.0.2.0, content to 3D collaboration in PTC FlexPLM can only be shared using the native integration to Browzwear or CLO. Browzwear or CLO integration must be enabled to share data with PTC FlexPLM . Your account representative or PTC Cloud Service Manager must add this optional service to your subscription. \u2022 After you are signed up for both the services listed above, you as the system administrator receive a secure authentication key for the specific PTC FlexPLM instance. Follow instructions to securely deploy and enable this key that allows specific 3D content to be shared with the cloud service irrespective of whether your PTC FlexPLM instance is in PTC Cloud, your own private cloud, or on-premises. \u2022 Follow the instructions to enable the relevant properties to handle 3D collaboration. Follow the application setup instructions to ensure that the set of required types and attributes are loaded. Sub-types for 3D collaboration PTC FlexPLM 12.0.2.0 onward, to support optimization of 3D content, new sub-types under retail document are available as part of the standard PTC FlexPLM installation. These sub-types are disabled by default. The system administrator must manually enable them by providing read-only permissions to the appropriate user group using the Windchill policy administrator tool. The following figure lists the sub-types, followed by their details. Visual Asset Visual asset is a sub-type of retail document and parent type of a 3D view. Currently, you cannot create or update any instances of this type from the PTC FlexPLM user interface; these instances are managed by the 3D plug-in. This type serves as the parent of multiple content-format specific types such as 3D view in GLB format. A visual asset instance can reference a product, material, sample, or a colorway, signifying the type of PTC FlexPLM object it intends to represent. 3D View 3D view is a sub-type of the visual asset. The secondary content of this document is used to render optimized 3D files in the Vntana web viewer component. The primary content of 3D view is optional and is available only for 3D views that are generated by the CLO plug-in. These instances are created or updated only by plug-in REST services. You can browse to the 3D view instance using any one of the following methods: \u2022 Access a 3D view instance from those listed on product header menu available under Product > Visual Asset > 3D View \u2022 Search for 3D view instances in the library and browse to one of them. \u2022 Select the instance in the 3D views listed under the visual asset tab on the sample's page. 3D view type is enabled only if 3D viewer is enabled. You can also create a 3D view directly in the browser without plug-ins. You must drag .glb file(s) to the Visual Asset carousel drop zone. The 3D file(s) get optimized and then are displayed in 3D view. 3D Model 3D model is a sub-type of retail document that is created by the 3D plug-ins. The primary content of 3D model document is .bw or .zprj files. In PTC FlexPLM releases before 12.0.2.0, the 3D model type was available in the 3D plug-ins installers. PTC FlexPLM 12.0.2.0 onward, the 3D model type is available in the standard PTC FlexPLM installation. Currently, instances of 3D model are managed using the 3D plug-in REST APIs. You can associate a developed 3D design to a product, colorway, sample, and material. You can browse to the 3D model instance from the library. 3D model is enabled only if the 3D plug-in is enabled. Turntable Turntable is a sub-type of the images page that is created by 3D plug-ins containing static PNG files to rotate and zoom the design content. In PTC FlexPLM releases before 12.0.2.0, the turntable type was available in the 3D plug-ins installers. PTC FlexPLM 12.0.2.0 onward, the turntable type is available in the standard PTC FlexPLM installation. Currently, instances of turntable are managed using 3D plug-in rest APIs. Was this helpful?
